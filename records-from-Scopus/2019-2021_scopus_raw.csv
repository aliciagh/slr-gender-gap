However, the impact of the gender image of school science subjects on young people's career choice has not yet been analyzed. This paper investigates the impact of the masculinity image of three school subjects—chemistry, mathematics, and physics—on secondary students' career aspirations in STEM fields. The data originated from a cross-sectional study among 1'364 Swiss secondary school students who were close to obtaining their matriculation diploma. By means of a standardized survey, data on students' perception of masculinity of science school subjects were collected using semantic differentials. The results indicate that for both sexes, math has the strongest masculinity attribution, followed by physics as second, and, finally, chemistry with the lowest masculinity attribution. With respect to gender differences, our findings have shown that among female students, the attribution of masculinity to the three school subjects does not differ significantly, meaning that female students rated all subjects similarly strongly as masculine. Within the group of male students however, the attribution of masculinity to math compared to chemistry and physics differs significantly, whereas the attribution of masculinity to chemistry and physics does not. Our findings also suggest that gender-science stereotypes of math and science can potentially influence young women's and men's aspirations to enroll in a STEM major at university by showing that a less pronounced masculine image of science has the potential to increase the likelihood of STEM career aspirations. Finally, the paper discusses ways of changing the image of math and science in the context of secondary education in order to overcome the disparities between females and males in STEM. © Copyright © 2019 Makarova, Aeschlimann and Herzog.","career aspirations; gender; mathematics; science; secondary school students",,,,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 4060-129279","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Swiss National Science Foundation for financial support of the study Gender atypical careers of young women (Grant no. 4060-129279).",,,,,,"Aeschlimann, B., Herzog, W., Makarova, E., Frauen in MINT-Berufen: Retrospektive Wahrnehmung des mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlichen Unterrichts auf der Sekundarstufe I [Women in STEM professions: retrospective perception of mathematics and science in secondary school education] (2015) Zeitschr.

De l'Universitat s/n, Valencia, 46100, Spain","Lack of diversity, and specifically, gender diversity, is one of the key problems that both technological companies and academia are facing these days. Moreover, recent studies show that the number of female students enrolled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related disciplines have been decreasing in the last twenty years, while the number of women resigning from technological job positions remains unacceptably high. As members of a higher education institution, we foresee that working towards increasing and retaining the number of female students enrolled in STEM disciplines can help to alleviate part of the challenges faced by women in STEM fields. In this paper, we first review the main barriers and challenges that women encounter in their professional STEM careers through different age stages. Next, we focus on the special case of the information theory field, discussing the potential of gendered innovation, and whether it can be applied in the Information Theory case. The working program developed by the School of Engineering at the University of Valencia (ETSE-UV), Spain, which aims at decreasing the gender diversity gap, is then presented and recommendations for practice are given. This program started in 2011 and it encompasses Bachelor, Master and PhD levels. Four main actions are implemented: Providing institutional encouragement and support, increasing the professional support network, promoting and supporting the leadership, and increasing the visibility of female role models. To assess the impact of these actions, a chi-square test of independence is included to evaluate whether there is a significant effect on the percentage of enrolled female students. The percentage of graduated female students in the information and Communications Technology Field is also positioned with respect to other universities and the Spanish reference value. This analysis establishes that, in part, this program has helped to achieve higher female graduation rates, especially among Bachelor students, as well as increasing the number of top-decision positions held by faculty women. © 2019 by the authors.","Gender diversity; Gendered innovation; Women in STEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Future TechWorkforce: Breaking the Gender Barriers, , http://www.isaca.org/info/2017-women-in-technology-survey/index.html, (accessed on 21 September 2018); Lamolla, L., González Ramos, A.M., Tick-tock sounds different for women working in IT areas (2018) Community Work Fam, pp. 1-16; She Figures 2015 (2016) Gender in Research and Innovation.

In particular, the gender gap is pronounced in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at all levels of education and labour market. In those areas, the women participation remains low, although there are differences from country to country. In the Latin American context, there is a need for carrying out studies to collect quality data about the actual situation of women in STEM. Although some available data show a high proportion of women in Latin American university education, they are a minority in STEM programs. Moreover, this problem is particularly severe in Latin America because of the biases or cultural norms that influence female behaviour. In this context, the W-STEM project seeks to improve strategies and mechanisms for attracting, accessing, and guiding women in Latin America in STEM higher education programs. This work aims to describe the main results to prepare a set of attraction campaigns in secondary schools in the Latin American countries involved in the project (Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico). In particular, a self-assessment tool about gender equality in higher education institutions in Latin America, an interview protocol for female role models, and a mobile application to show those role models. © 2019 ACM.","Gender equality; Gender gap; Higher education; Latin America; Mobile app; Self-assessment; STEM; Women","Ecosystems; Employment; Engineering education; Gender equality; Gender gap; Higher education; Latin America; Mobile app; Self assessment; Women; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2019) Generation Equality: Realizing Women's Rights for An Equal Future United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, , Un Women; (2016) STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA): Improved Measurement of Gender Equality in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, , Unesco; Larrondo-Petrie, M.M., Elicia Beltran-Martinez, M., Gender and engineering in the americas: A preliminary study in 2010, the inter-American year of women (2011) Proceedings of the 2011 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition (Vancouver, BC2011).

We use unique data on preference rankings for all secondary school students who apply for college in Ireland and detailed information on school subjects and grades to decompose the sources of the gender gap in STEM. We find that, of the 22 percentage points raw gap, about 13 percentage points is explained by differential subject choices and grades in secondary school. Subject choices are more important than grades – we estimate male comparative advantage in STEM (as measured by subject grades) explains about 3 percentage points of the gender gap. Additionally, differences in overall achievement between girls and boys have a negligible effect. Strikingly, there remains a gender gap of 9 percentage points even for persons who have identical preparation at the end of secondary schooling (in terms of both subjects studied and grades achieved); however, this gap is only 4 percentage points for STEM-ready students. We find that gender gaps are smaller among high-achieving students and for students who go to school in more affluent areas. There is no gender gap in science (the large gaps are in engineering and technology), and we also find a smaller gender gap when we include nursing degrees in STEM, showing that the definition of STEM used is an important determinant of the conclusions reached. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Education; Gender; STEM","curriculum; education; educational development; engineering; gender role; mathematics; science and technology",,,,,,,,,,,,"Anelli, M., Shih, K., Williams, K., (2017), https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/10743/foreign-peer-effects-and-stem-major-choice, “Foreign peer effects and STEM major choice.” IZA Discussion Paper No. 10743; Aucejo, E.M., James, J., (2016), ‘The path to college education: are Are verbal skills more important than math skills?’ Working Papers 1602, California Polytechnic State University, Department of Economics; Bedard, K., Cho, I., Early gender test score gaps across OECD countries (2010) Economics of Education Review, 29 (3), pp. 348-363; Beede, D.N., Julian, T.A., Langdon, D., McKittrick, G., Khan, B., Doms, M.E., Women in STEM: A gender gap to innovation (2011) Economics and statistics administration issue brief 04–11, , U.S. Department of Commerce Washington, DC; Black, S., He, Z., Muller, C., Spitz-Oener, A., (2015), On the origins of STEM: The role of high school STEM coursework in occupational determination and labour market success in mid life, University of Texas working paper; Brenøe, A.A., Zolitz, U., Exposure to more female peers widens the gender gap in STEM participation (2018), https://ssrn.com/abstract=3169812, University of Zurich, Department of Economics Working Paper No. 285.

However, the primary phases in gender differences are still ambiguous when examined from this perspective, possibly due to the fact that most of the studies have targeted samples of upper secondary school or college students. As such, in this study we examined the transient period to lower secondary school; our aim was to discover to what extent relationships between factors of students’ science interest and career perspectives differ between male and female. Based on previous studies and analyses, we selected three future career perspective variables–outcome, personal time, and innovation orientations–and three defining features of interest–personal value, enjoyment, and cognitive aspect. The sample was conducted in Finland and comprised of 401 grade 7 students aged 13, using a multi-group structural equation modelling. This study found that during the transient period there were clear gender differences regarding interest and preferences of science subjects, as well as their relationship towards future career perspectives. To be specific, biology was preferred by females, and males preferred physics and chemistry. With regard to future career perspectives, female students’ science interest was positively correlated with personal time- and innovation-oriented career perspectives; an outcome-oriented career expectation was negatively related to their interest. Interpretation and implication that might possibly arise from the results were also discussed. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The MultiCO project is an ongoing three-year project that was launched in 2015 and focuses on developing scenarios related to science careers. The aim is to make science more attractive to students between the ages of 13 to 15. During the project, teachers, researchers and other partners designed five successive interventions with science-related scenarios. In addition, in order to measure students” perceptional changes such as their interest in science, a questionnaire was developed by the MultiCO project team that is based on previous studies such as PRiSE or PISA. The original questionnaire comprises of several pages that concentrate on students’ science experiences in and out of school, career aspiration, interest in science, the value of science, etc. (see the attached online supplementary material 1). In this study, the sections were designed to consider three characteristics of interest (personal value, enjoyment, and the cognitive aspect) and future career perspectives (FCPs).

This attrition is especially pronounced among underrepresented groups (i.e., racial/ ethnic minorities and first-generation college students). We conducted a 2-year follow-up of a utility-value intervention that had been implemented in an introductory biology course. This intervention was previously shown to improve performance in the course, on average and especially among underrepresented students, reducing the achievement gap. The goal of the present study was to examine whether the intervention also impacted persistence in the biomedical track throughout college. The intervention had a more positive impact on long-term persistence for students who were more confident that they could succeed at the beginning of the course, and this effect was partially driven by the extent to which students reflected on the personal relevance of biological topics in their essays. This mechanism was distinct from the process that had been found to underlie intervention effects on performance-engagement with course material-suggesting that utility-value interventions may affect different academic outcomes by initiating distinct psychological processes. Although we did not find that the intervention was differentially effective for underrepresented students in terms of persistence, we found that positive effects on performance were associated with increased persistence for these students. Results suggest that utility-value interventions in an introductory course can be an effective strategy to promote persistence in the biomedical sciences throughout college. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Expectancy-value theory; Intervention science; STEM diversity; STEM persistence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hecht, C.A.",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,00220663,,,,"English","J.

Recent studies show that women are enrolling STEM studies in smaller proportion than men and that they have a larger probability to renounce to their jobs or to take leaves. In this scenario, the involvement of educational institutions is seminal to change this trend. The School of Engineering of the University of Valencia (ETSE-UV), Spain, launched in 2011 a pilot program to promote STEM careers, focusing on increasing and retaining the number of female students choosing these studies. Building from this experience, the Girls4STEM project has been launched in 2019 with the aim of reaching female students from 6 to 18 years old, their families and teachers. In this paper, we present and motivate the project's objectives and main activities, framing them in current state of the art's literature. Preliminary results of the pilot program actions are presented, demonstrating the statistically significant impact on the percentage of enrolled female students and motivating the subsequent Girls4STEM project. © 2013 IEEE.","Gender gap; Girls4STEM; ICT; STEM","Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Academic community; Digital society; Educational institutions; Gender equality; Quality education; School of engineering; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; State of the art; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; European Commission, EC; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: MTM2016-77501-P; Universitat de València, 85|86: UV-SFPIE-PID19-1097673, UV-SFPIE-PID19-1097874, UV-SFPIE-PID19-1098335; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF: RTI2018-095820-B-I00; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología, FECYT: FCT-18-13147","The authors would like to thank Capgemini (https://www.capgemini.com/en), Singularity Experts (https://singularity-experts.com/), and all the project’s sponsors.

The model used for the analysis takes as reference the Entrepreneurship Competences Framework (EntreComp) proposed by the European Commission (EC) as a common guide to inspire entrepreneurship education. Data gathering is based on a structured questionnaire. The conducted analysis uses Student’s t test means comparison and factor analysis to define the model of competences, and a multiple regression model to study the relationship between competences and skill factors in EI. Findings do not validate the hypothesis that women have fewer entrepreneurship intentions than men. Also, slight differences on the self-perceived competences are obtained by gender. In addition, the study confirms the hypothesis of a positive relationship between competences and EI, but here gender is not a moderating factor. Results are expected to contribute to the entrepreneurship competences debate and provide useful insights of application in entrepreneurship education with orientation towards the business creation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Entrepreneurship competences (EntreComp); Entrepreneurship education; Entrepreneurship intention; Gender in entrepreneurship; Women entrepreneurship intention",,,,,,"Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, UPM","The authors want to acknowledge the collaboration of the ActuaUPM program of the Technical University of Madrid, and particularly express their gratitude to Ms. Elisa Navarro, coordinator of the program, for her proactive collaboration and support.",,,,,,"Kearney, A.T., (2015) A Portrait of 21St-Century Business Leadership; Agudo, A., Chaparro, J., Hernandez, A., Iglesias, S., Marin, D., Navarro, E., Pascual, F., Portillo, J., (2014) De La Idea a La Empresa.

However, there is little evidence on what the long-run impacts may be and through what mechanisms these impacts may emerge. We exploit panel data from middle schools in Seoul, South Korea, where students and teachers are randomly assigned to classrooms. We replicate the existing literature that examines contemporaneous effects and find that female students taught by a female versus a male teacher score higher on standardized tests compared to male students even five years later. We also find that having a female math teacher in seventh grade increases the likelihood that female students attend a STEM-focused high school, take higher-level math courses, and aspire to a STEM degree. These effects are driven by changes in students' attitudes and choices. © 2020 the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

However, research shows that STEM learning environments are inhospitable to students with minoritized identities-most notably, women, people of color, and people with disabilities (e.g., Gottfried, Bozick, Rose, & Moore, 2016; O'Brien, Blodorn, Adams, Garcia, & Hammer, 2015; Stout, Grunberg, & Ito, 2016). Almost no research has examined the experiences of students with minoritized identities of sexuality and/or gender (MIoSG) in STEM. Using grounded theory, this study documented how 56 students with MIoSG experienced and navigated a pervasive culture of centering cisgender heterosexual men within STEM learning environments-referred to by students as dude or bro culture. Rich quotes from participants across gender and sexual identity spectra described how dude/bro culture included bonding over hypermasculinity, assuming heterosexuality, perpetuating anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual discourses, treating students with MIoSG as if they are not smart or invisible, and objectifying and sexualizing cisgender women.

Universities have embraced the commercialisation of knowledge, technology transfer and research funding as well as introducing performance and audit practices. Academic capitalism has become internalised as a regulatory mechanism by academics who attempt to accumulate academic capital. Universities are traditionally gendered organisations, reflecting the societal gender order. Despite fears regarding the feminisation of the academy, the embrace of academic capitalism is contributing to its re-masculinisation and exercises an incidental gender effect. Practicing is the means by which the gender order is constituted at work. Three practices in which academics engage are examined as exemplars of the way academics increase their academic capital stock in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) faculties in four European universities, in Bulgaria, Denmark, Ireland and Turkey. These practices tend to be more achievable and likely to be engaged in by men, thus, career practices are the mechanism through which the gender effect of academic capitalism is achieved, academic capitalism perpetuated and the gender order maintained in STEM in academia. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Academic capitalism; career practices; gender effect; gender order; STEM; universities",,,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 287526; European Commission, EC","This work was supported by the European Commission: [Grant Number 287526].

Furthermore, Latin America and Europe have more women than men enrolled in tertiary education. The problem arises when those numbers are analysed by degree studies. There is a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), with a low number of women enrolled in those programs and even lower numbers of graduates. The universities have a key role to steer new conceptions and understanding of the females in STEM. The higher education institutions have to define measures and policies to reduce the gender gap in the careers of the future. This work aims to provide a proposal to analyse the gender equality gap in STEM as a first step to define gender equality action plans focused on processes of attraction, access and retention and guidance in STEM programs. The proposal was applied in ten Latin American universities from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico, and five European universities from Finland, Ireland, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom. © 2020 IEEE.","Framework; Gender gap; Self-analysis; STEM; University","Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Educational attainments; European universities; Gender equality; Higher education institutions; Latin americans; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Tertiary education; United kingdom; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Convert, B., Gugenheim, F., Scientific vocations in crisis in France: Explanatory social developments and mechanisms (2005) European Journal of Education, 40 (4), pp. 417-431; Convert, B., Europe and the crisis in scientific vocations (2005) European Journal of Education, 40 (4), pp. 361-366; Rocard, M., Csermely, P., Jorde, D., Lenzen, D., Walwerg-Heriksson, H., Hemmo, V., (2007) EUR22845-Science Education NOW: A Renewed Pedagogy for the Future of Europe, , Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities; Garci'A-Holgado, A., Gonzalez, C.S., Peixoto, A., Bridging the diversity gap in STEM (2019) Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2019), pp. 193-195. , Leon, Spain, October 16-18, 2019, M.

Still, enrolment rates in STEM degrees are low in many European countries and consequently there is a lack of adequately educated workforce in industries. We believe that this can be mainly attributed to pedagogical issues, such as the lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools. In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of pre-university students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content. A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a pan-European contest that attracted > 700 participants. The statistical analysis and results revealed that the platform and contest positively influenced participants STEM learning and motivation, while only the gender factor for the younger study group appeared to affect the outcomes (confidence level - <.05). © 2008-2011 IEEE.","collaborative learning; Computer and Information science education; computers and society; social and behavioral sciences; software engineering for internet projects; STEM education","Behavioral research; Knowledge based systems; Motivation; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Collaborative learning; Computer and information science educations; Computers and societies; Internet projects; Social and behavioral science; STEM education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research, EMPIR: 665868; European Commission, EC","As shown in Table I there are many contests, projects and initiatives for generating interest in STEM. A very important dimension that needs to be further exploited is Web 2.0. In fact, the advent of Web 2.0 has changed the way we create and use content. Also, in Web 2.0 the roles of content creator and consumer are blurred, where users are provided a service and create (generate) the content. As stated in [15]: “This community participation in the creation of shared resources is made possible by Web 2.0 technologies in which individuals make material available to be used and modified by others.” Another important dimension of Web 2.0 is that it enables linking humans and organizations in what is known as social networks or social media [16]. To highlight the importance of the social media dimension, in 2008 the European Commission under the umbrella organisation Marie Sk»odowska Curie actions Research Fellowship Programme released an inspiring educational video for chemical research. The video is targeting youngsters and it is designed in a funny way at the level of juveniles. With over 2.5 million views and hundreds of comments the video was a huge success. The above and the fact that the hashtag #scichallenge is not in use highlights, show that a digital science challenge is of utter importance.","Manuscript received September 1, 2017; revised December 14, 2017; accepted February 14, 2018.

This study, grounded in Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT), identified and modeled the factors that contributed to students' academic choices from their own subjective perspectives. We collected qualitative and quantitative data from ninth graders in two urban middle-schools (n=295) at the school year's end. We found that (a) most students cited interest and utility value as their main motivations for choosing a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) major, expectancies were mentioned less; (b) students who chose a STEM major had statistically significant higher scores for EVT's key predictor variables (personal attributes, “subjective task value,” “expectation of success,” perceived effects of environmental factors) than their counterparts who majored in non-STEM disciplines; (c) the positive perceptions of their peers' interest and ability in science contributed significantly to students' choice to major in STEM disciplines; and (d) no significant gender differences re academic choice were found. One highly unexpected finding emerged: Participation in advanced science programs for highly qualified students (“ability grouping with curriculum differentiation”) was by far the most significant factor in the choice to major in STEM disciplines. This finding has major implications for science education policy and practice. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","ability grouping with curriculum differentiation; academic choice; Expectancy-Value Theory; gender; STEM learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adedokun, O.A., Bessenbacher, A.B., Parker, L.C., Kirkham, L.L., Burgess, W.D., Research skills and STEM undergraduate research students' aspirations for research careers: Mediating effects of research self-efficacy (2013) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 50, pp. 940-951; Adelson, J.L., McCoach, D.B., Measuring the mathematical attitudes of elementary students: The effects of a 4-point or 5-point Likert-type scale (2010) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 70 (5), pp. 796-807; Adelson, J.L., McCoach, D.B., Gavin, M.K., Examining the effects of gifted programming in mathematics and reading using the ECLS-K (2012) Gifted Child Quarterly, 56 (1), pp. 25-39; Ames, C., Classroom: Goals, structures and student motivation (1992) Journal of Educational Psychology, 84 (3), pp. 261-271; (2019), https://www.apa.org/topics/socioeconomic-status/, American Psychological Association (,).

However, the bulk of studies focused on gender stereotypes related to mathematics. The present study, therefore, aimed to map gender stereotypes and incremental beliefs (i.e., the conviction about modifiability) with respect to a wide range of stereotypical male-favouring and female-favouring abilities. Gender stereotypes and incremental beliefs were assessed with self-report questionnaires in 132 STEM students (65 women) and 124 non-STEM students (73 women) in three European countries ranked in the top, middle, and bottom of the Global Gender Gap Report. Moreover, a mental rotation and a verbal fluency test were completed. Men endorsed male-favouring stereotypes more than women, and women endorsed female-favouring stereotypes more than men, an effect that was most pronounced in the country with the larger gender gap. Male STEM students endorsed male-favouring stereotypes more strongly than male non-STEM and female STEM students. Male non-STEM students endorsed female-favouring stereotypes less than female and male STEM students. Female STEM students reported higher incremental beliefs than female non-STEM students, especially in the country with the lowest gender gap. Men outperformed women, and STEM students outperformed non-STEM in mental rotation, while women outperformed men in verbal fluency. Male STEM students’ stronger endorsement of male-favouring stereotypes might reflect genuine group differences, at least in mental rotation. While potentially such gender stereotypes can help creating a “chilly climate” where women in academic STEM degrees are expected to perform poorly, those women believed more in the possibility to change and improve in male-favouring abilities which could help them to overcome the potential negative effect of stereotyping. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"academic achievement; adult; education; engineering; Europe; female; human; male; mathematics; questionnaire; sex factor; stereotyping; stereotypy; student; technology; Academic Performance; Adult; Engineering; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Sex Factors; Stereotyped Behavior; Stereotyping; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology",,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca, MIUR; Università degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD; Bergens Forskningsstiftelse: BFS2016REK03","We are very grateful to Edoardo Biancullo, Giovanni Carta, and Arianna Marola (University of Padua), Thomas Frotvedt, Malin Funnemark, Bodil Haugen, Mai Emilie Ramdahl, Juni Riis, Karoline Sandanger, Nathanum Smith, Mina Thorvaldsen, and Maren Vistnes (University of Bergen), as well as Demi Alexandrou, Rebecca Barton, Fiona Hathaway, Hannah Kwek, and Sarah Thomas (Durham University) who helped us with data collection.

Using Danish administrative data, we exploit idiosyncratic within-school variation in gender composition. We find that having a larger proportion of female peers reduces women’s probability of enrolling in and graduating from STEM programs. Men’s STEM participation increases with more female peers present. In the long run, women exposed to more female peers are less likely to work in STEM occupations, earn less, and have more children. Our findings show that the school peer environment has lasting effects on occupational sorting, the gender wage gap, and fertility. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

On the basis of a race composition study of the stem rust populations collected in 2016.2017 in Omsk region and Altai Krai, 13 pathotypes in Omsk population and 10 in Altai population were identified. The race differentiation of stem rust using a tester set of 20 North American Sr genes differentiator lines was carried out. The genes of stem rust pathotypes of the Omsk population are avirulent only to the resistance gene Sr31, Altai isolates are avirulent not only to Sr31, but also to Sr24, and Sr30. A low frequency of virulence (10.25 %) of the Omsk population pathotypes was found for Sr11, Sr24, Sr30, and for Altai population - Sr7b, Sr9b, Sr11, SrTmp, which are ineffective in Omsk region. Field evaluations of resistance to stem rust were made in 2016-2018 in Omsk region in the varieties and spring wheat lines from three different sources. The first set included 58 lines and spring bread wheat varieties with identified Sr genes - the so-called trap nursery (ISRTN - International Stem Rust Trap Nursery). The second set included spring wheat lines from the Arsenal collection, that were previously selected according to a complex of economically valuable traits, with genes for resistance to stem rust, including genes introgressed into the common wheat genome from wild cereal species. The third set included spring bread wheat varieties created in the Omsk State Agrarian University within the framework of a shuttle breeding program, with a synthetic wheat with the Ae. tauschii genome in their pedigrees. It was established that the resistance genes Sr31, Sr40, Sr2 complex are effective against stem rust in the conditions of Western Siberia. The following sources with effective Sr genes were selected: (Benno)/6∗LMPG-6 DK42, Seri 82, Cham 10, Bacanora (Sr31), RL 6087 Dyck (Sr40), Amigo (Sr24, 1RS-Am), Siouxland (Sr24, Sr31), Roughrider (Sr6, Sr36), Sisson (Sr6, Sr31, Sr36), and Fleming (Sr6, Sr24, Sr36, 1RS-Am), Pavon 76 (Sr2 complex) from the ISRTN nursery; No. 1 BC1F2 (96 × 113) × 145 × 113 (Sr2, Sr36, Sr44), No. 14a F3 (96 × 113) × 145 (Sr36, Sr44), No. 19 BC2F3 (96 × 113) × 113 (Sr2, Sr36, Sr44), and No. 20 F3 (96 × 113) × 145 (Sr2, Sr36, Sr40, Sr44) from the Arsenal collection; and the Omsk State Agrarian University varieties Element 22 (Sr31, Sr35), Lutescens 27-12, Lutescens 87-12 (Sr23, Sr36), Lutescens 70-13, and Lutescens 87-13 (Sr23, Sr31, Sr36). These sources are recommended for inclusion in the breeding process for developing stem rust resistant varieties in the region. c Shamanin V.P., Pototskaya I.V., Shepelev S.S., Pozherukova V.E., Salina E.A., Skolotneva E.S., Hodson D., Hovmoller M., Patpour M., Morgounov A.I., 2020. © 2020 Institute of Cytology and Genetics of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

This gap covers all ages and contexts, from education - primary school to university level - to the labour market. In the last decades, a large number of initiatives have emerged to work actively in promoting gender equality in STEM. Also, from an I+D point of view, in the European context, several projects focused on the gender gap and diversity in STEM have been funded through different programmes. In order to get an overview of the European context, a systematic mapping study of projects related to the gender gap in STEM was conducted in CORDIS, Erasmus+ and KEEP databases. A total number of 435 projects were analysed, and 31 projects were selected to get the overview. The paper describes the methodology used to conduct the analysis, an adaptation of techniques from the systematic literature review and systematic mapping reviews usually used for scientific papers. Finally, the results from the mapping review are described. © 2019 ACM.","Education; European projects; European research; Gender gap; STEM; Systematic literature mapping","Education; Employment; Human computer interaction; Mapping; European project; European research; Gender gap; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Scientific papers; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Systematic mapping studies; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"García-Holgado, A., Vázquez-Ingelmo, A., Verdugo-Castro, S., González, C.S., Sánchez-Gómez, M.C., García-Peñalvo, F.J., Actions to promote diversity in engineering studies: A case study in a Computer Science Degree (2019) 2019 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), , (9-11 April 2019, Dubai, UAE) IEEE, USA; Lee, W.C., Matusovich, H.M., Brown, P.R., Measuring underrepresented student perceptions of inclusion within engineering departments and universities (2014) International Journal of Engineering Education, 30 (1), pp. 150-165; Peixoto, A., González, C.S.G., Strachan, R., Plaza, P., De Los Martinez Angeles, M., Blazquez, M., Castro, M., Diversity and inclusion in engineering education: Looking through the gender question (2018) 2018 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), (17-20 April 2018, pp. 2071-2075. , Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain) IEEE, USA; Icart Isern, M.T., Canela Soler, J., El artículo de revisión (1994) Enfermería Clínica, 4 (4), pp. 180-184; Guirao-Goris, J.A., Olmedo Salas, A., Ferrer Ferrandis, E., El artículo de revisión (2008) Revista Iberoamericana de Enfermeria Comunitaria, 1, p. 1; García-Peñalvo, F.J., (2017) Revisión Sistemática de Literatura en Los Trabajos de Final de Máster y en Las Tesis Doctorales, , Grupo GRIAL; Kitchenham, B., (2004) Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews; Kitchenham, B., Charters, S., (2007) Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering.

Differences, however, exist between various STEM domains: While engineering and technology appear especially unattractive, subjects such as mathematics, biology, or chemistry have better chances at attracting women. Research has mostly neglected these differences, treating STEM as an overall category. In the light of the differences in the proportions of women enrolled in and dropping out of various STEM subjects, the present study takes a more differentiated look to separately investigate the STEM subjects that have a low or moderate proportion of females. The following study focuses on female university students' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in these two groups of STEM subjects, asking to what degree the academic STEM self-concept and support experienced in both school and the family contribute to the motivation to study a STEM topic. Four hundred sixty-nine female students took part in the investigation. Two hundred eighty-four of them were enrolled in STEM subjects with a low proportion of females (STEM-LPF) and 185 in STEM subjects with a moderate proportion of females (STEM-MPF). A comparison of the two samples shows that women in STEM-LPF exceed women in STEM-MPF with regard to their academic STEM self-concept and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Different variables contribute to motivation in the two samples. For STEM-LPF, a latent regression analysis found positive relationships between the academic STEM self-concept and both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, while support experienced in school and from the family was not related to motivation. By contrast, in the STEM-MPF sample, the academic self-concept was not related to motivation. Previous interest in STEM subjects in school contributed positively to present intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. An unexpected result, however, was found concerning activities in school that were designed to promote interest in STEM. Memories of these kinds of activities were negatively related to both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. These measures might be experienced as intrusive support: attempts to promote STEM sometimes might backfire and achieve the opposite of what was intended. © 2019 Luttenberger, Paechter and Ertl.","Academic self-concept; Gender; Latent regression analysis; Motivation; School factors; STEM; University students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adya, M., Kaiser, K.M., Early determinants of women in the IT workforce: a model of girls' career choices (2005) Inf.

In computer programming courses, a context where social group stereotypes are salient, social cues early in the course can be used strategically to affirm members of historically underrepresented groups in their sense of belonging. We tested this idea in two randomized field experiments (N=53,922) by varying the social identity and status of the presenter of a welcome video and assessing online learners' persistence and achievement. Counter to our hypotheses, we found lower persistence among women in certain age groups if the welcome video was presented by a female instructor or by lower-status peers. Men remained unaffected. The results suggest that women are more responsive to social cues in online STEM courses, an environment where their social identity has been negatively stereotyped. Presenting a male and female instructor together was an effective strategy for retaining women in the course. © 2020 ACM.","computer science; education; gender; inclusion; psychology","Computer programming; Human engineering; Computer programming course; Field experiment; First impressions; Online course; Sense of belonging; Social groups; Social identity; Under-represented groups; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Ambady, N., Rosenthal, R., Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness (1993) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64 (3), p. 431. , (1993); Anderson, C., John, O.P., Keltner, D., Kring, A.M., Who attains social status?

Focusing on the mathematics choice (basic/advanced/no mathematics), a large register dataset that covered students admitted to Finnish universities during 2013–2015 (N = 46,281) was combined with upper-secondary school matriculation examination data (N = 93,955) to find out how this choice influenced the students’ university admissions. This large dataset was also examined to establish the current gender distributions in different university degree programs from the perspective of mathematics choices. Further, to find out the students’ reasons behind their mathematics choices, a cohort sample of 802 student responses was collected from upper-secondary schools. We also investigated the students’ interests in different fields of study to establish any gender differences in them. Results: The register data analysis suggested that in Finland, students’ mathematics choices had a strong influence on the university admission outcomes. For instance, only 33% of the upper-secondary school graduates took the advanced mathematics ME test in 2013–2015, yet the number of those admitted to universities who had taken the advanced mathematics ME test was 55%. Most of the university degree programs were female dominated, yet the university students with advanced mathematics were mostly male, and especially the STEM fields in the Finnish universities were male dominated. As for the reasons behind the mathematics choices, students who chose advanced mathematics believed in its usefulness for their future studies and careers. We also found significant gender-based educational differences regarding all the study fields, with STEM careers attracting more males than females. Conclusion: Advanced mathematics was highly valued in Finnish universities, and many students chose advanced mathematics believing in its usefulness for their future studies or careers. Yet, their further study interests and career plans were segregated by gender. As there is a rising need for STEM skills, we must seek effective ways to deliver the evolving possibilities of STEM fields to students, especially girls, during the earlier years of their educations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Gender gap in STEM; Gender segregation in disciplines; Mathematics choice; STEM careers; STEM fields; STEM subjects; University admissions; Upper-secondary school students’ mathematical choice",,,,,,"China Scholarship Council, CSC; Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan; Oulun Yliopisto","The authors are grateful for receiving funding for this research from the University of Oulu, the Adult Education Allowance of Finland, and from the Oulu University project regarding student admissions, funded by the Ministry of Education and Culture .","The authors thank the students, student counselors, teachers, and principals of Oulu upper secondary schools, also the staff of the Department of Education and culture of Oulu, for giving their time and support for this study.

New kind of people with a multiple background are sought by recruiters and industry is already suffering from a severe labour shortage. One of the solutions have been to get more to the industry and past decades a lot of work has been done for getting more women for the STEM industries. However, the results have not been as efficient that would have hoped for and in addition to this, women who are working already in the industry are not pursuing towards more technical or manager positions.This paper addresses the question what motivates adult age women to make a career change to the software industry in Finland. The background data for the paper was collected with an open internet survey (n=134) from Finnish women who have already made or are planning to make a career change to the software industry. This study shows that Finnish women are motivated to make a career change to the software industry, but face different kind of challenges starting from lack of proper career counseling, uncertainty about the right kind of education to the industry and dream job and for example challenges with their self-esteem and 'imposter syndrome'. The paper discusses on the findings and reflects the need for further research on the topic. © 2019 IEEE.","career change; gender bias; gender in ICT; re-education; skills; Women in STEM","Engineering research; Software engineering; career change; Career counseling; Gender bias; gender in ICT; Internet survey; Self esteem; skills; Software industry; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Schwab, K., (2018) The Fourth Industrial Revolution, , https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-12-12/fourth-industrial-revolution, Foreign Affairs, January 2018 accessed January 23; Chakravorti, B., Bhalla, A., Chaturvedi, R.S., 60 countries' digital competitiveness, indexed (2017) Harvard Business Review; Luoma, E., Rönkkö, M., Tahvanainen, S., (2017) Ohjelmistoyrityskartoitus 2017.

Through applying these initiatives, faculties can help to reduce the gender imbalance, increase diversity and the amount of computer science specialists, who are requested immensely. Based on the results of conducted requirements elicitation a concept for programming an application with the NAO robot which trains vocabularies, as well as a concept with the Cozmo robot which piles up cubes, were developed. First tests were performed with female and male high school students. Either concept consists of an introduction of possible robotics application fields, a presentation explaining the Python program code of the concept as well as corresponding exercises with the robot and Python. Evaluation of the workshop concepts through questionnaires showed that both concepts have the potential to increase the proportion of women and to motivate female as well as male students for computer science. Moreover, recommendations for further robotics projects with respect to motivating young women for STEM can be made based on the insights of the requirements elicitation and the evaluation of the concepts. Nevertheless, further refinement and validation has to be undertaken. Long-term as well as short-term initiatives are feasible with the developed concepts. All participating schools showed high interest in both types of initiatives and further cooperation. © 2019 IEEE.","Diversity; Proportion of women in stem; Robotics in k-12 education; Women in computer science","Application programs; Education computing; High level languages; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Requirements engineering; Robot programming; Robotics; Robots; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Surveys; Diversity; High school students; K-12 education; K-12 STEM education; Program code; Requirements elicitation; Robotics applications; Robotics projects; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,"Peiris, D.R., Gregor, I.V.P., Women and computing breaking the cycle of imbalance at the interface (2000) Women, Work and Computerization Charting A Course to the Future, pp. 34-41. , E.

While violence refers to a way to interact with others, stems from the historical and ancient segregation of women by the fact of being women. This type of violence has its origins in the sexual division of labor and private property. Slavery, which was originally only female, shaped conformed as the most barbaric form of domination. As a result, a symbolic whole world order has been established to legitimize that subordination that is present in every order and exerted through social, cultural, political, psychological, legal, economic constructions and in the audiovisual environment. Gender violence, as a social aggression that is culturally learned, is a strategy to subjugate women that is expressed in many ways: abusive relationships, harassment, etc. Termination and prevention are fundamental measures in gender violence. In this vein, equality and nonviolence are essential for the progress and development of human rights and dignity. © 2019 Hipatia Editorial.

Recent research on such ""field-specific ability beliefs"" has shown that a high emphasis on brilliance in a specific field goes along with a low share of female students among its graduates. A possible mediating mechanisms between cultural expectations and stereotypes on the one hand, and women's underrepresentation in math-intensive STEM fields on the other hand, is that women may be more likely than men to feel that they do not belong in these fields. In the present study, we investigated field-specific ability beliefs as well as belonging uncertainty in a sample of n = 1294 male and female university students from five STEM fields (Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering) at a prestigious technical university in Switzerland. Field-specific ability beliefs of both men and women emphasized brilliance more in more math-intensive fields (Mathematics, Physics) than in less math-intensive fields (Engineering). Women showed higher beliefs in brilliance than men did, and also reported higher levels of belonging uncertainty. For both genders, there was a small, positive correlation (r = 0.19) of belief in brilliance and belonging uncertainty. A relatively small, but significant portion of the effect of gender on belonging uncertainty was mediated by women's higher belief in brilliance. © 2019 Deiglmayr, Stern and Schubert.","Belonging uncertainty; Field-specific ability beliefs; Gender stereotypes; STEM gender gap; University students",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berkowitz, M., Stern, E., Which cognitive abilities make the difference?

Due to the well-known gender gap, the study is focused on analyzing possible differences between women and men in several socio-cognitive variables with a well-established relevance in vocational development. Differences along different grades of secondary education are also discussed. Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) is used as a framework. In this study 1,465 high school Spanish students were involved. All of them were evaluated for self-efficacy, outcome expectations, interests, support, occupational aspirations and perceived social barriers when starting careers in the science/mathematics area. Non-parametric statistic tests were applied as well as measures of the effect size comparing by gender and course. Significant differences were found in favor of males, usually of low magnitude, in all the variables analyzed with the exception of those concerning the occupational aspirations. Likewise, a significant tendency was identified to present lower averages in all the variables as it progresses in secondary school. However, the general pattern of results showed differentiating aspects when considering a course and/or a kind of high school curriculum. The results are discussed in the context of the previous research on this topic and future lines of work are suggested from the point of view of the research and also educational intervention. © 2019 Asociacion Interuniversitaria de Investigacion en Pedagogia.

This study analyses the preferences of elementary education girls and boys (n = 733) for the content of physics and biology using a quantitative analysis method based on clustering techniques (K-Means) and by analyzing the differences in their attitudes toward school science according to their preferences. The results reveal the existence of a sexually biased attitudinal profile, characterized by a high preference for the content of the biological sciences and a low preference for learning physics among girls, and opposite results in the case of boys. In addition, in comparison with boys, girls showed less interest in physics science content than boys, were majority in the attitudinal profiles characterized by a low overall interest in science content and minority in the profiles characterized by a high interest in both disciplines. These results seem to show that the preference for scientific disciplines in physics or biology are beginning to form from elementary levels of the educational system, which could lead to the subsequent gender segregation existing in STEM disciplines. The educational and research implications of these findings are discussed. © 2019 Asociacion de Profesores Amigos de la Ciencia Eureka.All right reserved.","Attitudes towards science; Biology; Cluster analysis; K-mean; Physics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1993) Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy, , Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science; (1996) Advisory Report 330: Anthropomorphic Dummies for Crash and Escape System Testing, , AGARD Quebec: Canada Communication Group; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, , New Jersey: Prentice-Hill; Battaglia, O.R., Di Paola, B., Fazio, C., K-means clustering to study how student reasoning lines can be modified by a learning activity based on Feynman's unifying approach (2017) Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education, 13 (6), pp. 2005-2038; Beede, D.N., Julian, T.A., Langdon, D., McKittrick, G., Khan, B., Doms, M.E., Women in STEM: A gender gap to innovation (2011) Economics and Statistics Administration, pp. 4-11; Berkhout, E., Sattinger, M., Theeuwes, J., Volkerink, M., (2012) Into The Gap.

The results demonstrated that women experienced more difficulties in finding a job, received fewer job offers, were less likely to find a job consistent with their education, and earned less money than men. Additionally, we examined the attributions that men and women made for their professional success and the characteristics that they sought in potential jobs. In comparison to men, women were less likely to attribute their success to stereotypically male characteristics and more likely to attribute their success to stereotypically female characteristics. Moreover, women were less likely than men to perceive agency-affording job characteristics (e.g., salary) as decisive features when making a decision about a job. The findings suggest that despite having the same educational background, the professional situations of male and female graduates differ. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues",,"comparative study; educational attainment; employment; gender disparity; gender role; working conditions; Poland [Central Europe]",,,,,"Narodowe Centrum Nauki, NCN: 1614/MOB/V/2017/0, 2015/19/B/HS6/01253","This research was supported by a grant from the National Science Center (2015/19/B/HS6/01253).

Twenty-one qualified PE teachers completed an online story completion method and results were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Comparisons were generated between the two-story stems: between male and female participants and between the hypothetical stories and direct question answers. Results showed that teachers’ perceptions largely conformed to typical gender stereotypes, including stereotypical views on gender roles, gendered sports and story character assumptions. Participants did not attribute stereotype reproduction to themselves as teachers and negative external pressures arose as a common reasoning for stereotypical practice. However, only female participants highlighted parents and peers as significant contributors, whereas both genders highlighted governmental pressures such as curriculum design. This study displayed that gender segregation, masculine and feminine discourses and gendered habitus are still prominent within PE. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bourdieu; Gender stereotypes; Physical Education; Teacher perceptions","adult; article; controlled study; curriculum; female; human; human experiment; male; perception; reasoning; reproduction; sex role; sport; stereotypy; teacher; thematic analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, D., Games for the boys: Sport, empire and the creation of the masculine ideal (2014) Routledge handbook of sport, gender and sexuality, pp. 21-29. , Hargreaves J., Anderson E., (eds), Routledge,.

This study challenged that notion by integrating theories of cognitive style, academic emotion, self-efficacy, and motivation to explain students’ academic achievement and perseverance in STEM when transitioning to college. A sample of 1597 high school and junior college students participated. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were first conducted to validate a reduced version of the cognitive style questionnaire. Structural equation modeling revealed that the cognitive style known as systemizing indirectly predicted STEM achievement and persistence by way of intrinsic motivation, learning anxiety, and self-efficacy, providing a new perspective for re-examining the gender gap in STEM. © 2018, The Author(s).","Cognitive style; Gender gap; Intrinsic motivation; Self-efficacy; STEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akin, A., Kurbanoglu, I.N., The relationships between math anxiety, math attitudes, and self-efficacy: A structural equation model (2011) Studia Psychologica, 53 (3), pp. 263-273; Ashcraft, M., Math anxiety: Personal, educational, and cognitive consequences (2002) Current Directions in Psychological Science, 11, pp. 181-185; Auyeung, B., Allison, C., Wheelwright, S., Baron-Cohen, S., Brief report: Development of the adolescent empathy and systemizing quotients (2012) Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 42, pp. 2225-2235; Baker, S.R., A prospective longitudinal investigation of social problem-solving appraisals on adjustment to university, stress, health, and academic motivation and performance (2003) Personality and Individual Differences, 35, pp. 569-591; Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: The exercise of control, , Freeman, New York, NY; Bandura, A., Wood, R., Effects of perceived controllability and performance standards on self-regulation of complex decision-making (1989) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, pp. 805-814; Bandura, A., Barbaranelli, C., Caprara, G.V., Pastorelli, C., Self-efficacy beliefs as shapers of children’s aspirations and career trajectories (2001) Child Development, 72, pp. 187-206; Baron-Cohen, S., (2003) The essential difference: The truth about the male and female brain, , Basic Books, New York, NY; Baron-Cohen, S., Autism, hypersystemizing, and truth (2008) The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61, pp. 64-75; Baron-Cohen, S., Richler, J., Bisarya, D., Gurunathan, N., Wheelwright, S., The systemizing quotient: An investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences (2003) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 358, pp. 361-374; Baron-Cohen, S., Cassidy, S., Auyeung, B., Allison, C., Achoukhi, M., Robertson, S., Lai, M.-C., Attenuation of typical sex differences in 800 adults with autism vs. 3,900 controls (2014) PLoS One, 9; Bentler, P.M., (1995) EQS 6 Structural Equations Program Manual, , Encino, CA, Multivariate Software, Inc; Bong, M., Skaalvik, E.M., Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?

We investigated motivational metrics in over 400 introductory biology students in Norway, a country lauded for its gender equality. Specifically, we measured test anxiety and science confidence and combined students’ survey responses with their performance in the class. Results: We found that female students expressed more test anxiety than did their male counterparts, and the anxiety they experienced negatively predicted their performance in class. By contrast, the anxiety male students experienced did not predict their performance. Conversely, men had higher confidence than women, and confidence interacted with gender, so that the difference between its impact on men’s and women’s performance was marginally significant. Conclusions: Our findings have implications for STEM instructors, in Norway and beyond: specifically, to counter gender-based performance gaps in STEM courses, minimize the effects of test anxiety. © 2020, The Author(s).","Gender equity; Higher education; Science confidence; STEM; Test anxiety",,,,,,"Direktoratet for internasjonalisering og kvalitetsutvikling i høgare utdanning, DIKU","The study was funded by a grant by NOKUT/DIKU under the Centres for Excellence in Higher Education Initiative to bioCEED – Centre of Excellence in Biology Education [2014–2024].

Similar issues can be spotted in the transport labor market, where only 22% of workers are women at the European level. The roots of these limitations are in the low participation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) studies and, therefore, in the traditionally male-dominated transport field occupations. Stemming from the European project TInnGO, the current paper proposes a descriptive analysis to evaluate the gender gaps in educational provision and research in ten European countries. Specific indicators, such as percentages in the gender composition or the presence of university courses dealing with mobility and transport, have been defined and their availability in different countries is verified. In addition, a desktop review of practices for encouraging and supporting women in STEM studies is operated, underling characteristics such as the kind of initiative, the methods and tools used, the target group or the type of promoter. The results of this activity show that a wide network of associations and mentoring operates in various European nations, mostly targeting secondary school students, trying to make females aware of their potentialities in a deeply genderbiased field like the STEM one. © 2020 by the authors.

Purpose/Hypothesis: This article challenges the aggregated approach, analyzes gender differences among science and engineering applicants in Finland, and discusses the implications of the findings for engineering education and intervention initiatives. Design/Method: The data consist of the application choices of all applicants to Bachelor studies in Finland in 2016 (151,369 individuals), from which two groups were selected: persons whose first application choice was engineering/technology and persons whose first choice was natural sciences or mathematics. The application choices of these individuals (in total 9,104) are statistically described and analyzed. Results: Engineering/technology (TECH) and natural sciences and mathematics (SCIMA) subjects are not perceived as alternative options by female applicants. Almost 60% of all female TECH applicants and more than 50% of the female SCIMA applicants apply only to their respective programs. Moreover, TECH applicants considering other options prefer other subjects to SCIMA and vice versa. Conclusions: Encouraging more girls to study STEM is not a sufficient solution for attracting more women to engineering. Instead of or in addition to encouraging girls to study science and mathematics in K-12 education, it is necessary to open the black box of technology and help young people better understand what engineering is about. © 2020 The Authors.

Female participation remains a concern in most jurisdictions, but female attainment in CS is relatively unstudied. Using the English national pupil database, we analyzed all exam results (n = 5,370,064) for students taking secondary school exams in 2016, focusing on those students taking GCSE CS (n = 60,736), contrasting this against ICT (n = 67,359). Combining gender with ethnicity and the IDACI poverty indicator, we find that females from the poorest areas were more likely to take CS than those from the richest areas and that CS was more popular among ethnic minority females than white females. ICT was far more equitable for females and poorer students than CS. CS females typically got better grades than their male peers. However, when controlling for average attainment in other subjects, males got 0.31 of a grade higher. Female relative underperformance in CS was most acute among large female cohorts and with girls studying in mixed-gender schools. Girls did significantly better than boys in English when controlling for CS scores, supporting theories around female relative strengths lying outside STEM subjects. The move to introduce CS into the English curriculum and the removal of the ICT qualifications look to be having a negative impact on female participation and attainment in computing. Using the theory of self-efficacy, we argue that the shift towards CS might decrease the number of girls choosing further computing qualifications or pursuing computing as a career. Computing curriculum designers and teachers need to carefully consider the inclusive nature of their computing courses. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Self-efficacy; STEM","Curricula; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Computing course; Computing curricula; Ethnic minorities; Relative strength; Secondary schools; Self efficacy; Underperformance; Computation theory",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aleman, A., Bronk, E., Kessels, R.P.C., Koppeschaar, H.P.F., Van Honk, J., A single administration of testosterone improves visuospatial ability in young women (2004) Psychoneuroendocrinology, 29 (5), pp. 612-617. , 2004; Ambrosio, A.P., Almeida, L.S., Macedo, J., Rodrigues Franco, A.H., Exploring core cognitive skills of computational thinking (2014) Psychology of Programming Interest Group Annual Conference 2014 (PPIG’14), pp. 25-34; Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Wong, B., Spheres of influence: What shapes young people’s aspirations at age 12/13 and what are the implications for education policy?

Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males. © 2019 ACM.","Code-literacy; Computational Thinking; Computer Education; Elementary Education; Families; Gender; Primary School; Unplugged","Codes (symbols); Computational methods; Computer programming; Ecosystems; Code-literacy; Computational thinkings; Computer education; Elementary education; Families; Gender; Primary schools; Unplugged; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2012) Meta-analysis of Gender and Science Research-Synthesis Report, , https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/meta-analysis-of-gender-and-science-research-synthesis-report.pdf, European Commission.

In Japan, it has been reported that the size of the workforce has been substantially decreasing since 2011. One of the effective strategies to mitigate the risk of the shortage of human resources is considered to be making use of women in the STEM field. In this paper, the Japanese transport sector is studied to understand the role of VET to support women in the STEM workforce. We shed light on the merchant marine as one of the most male-dominated industries. A comparative institutional analysis was elaborated with other transport industries, such as air and rail. In addition, a narrative analysis was conducted with the empirical data as well as archived literature. The paper reveals that the merchant marine has failed to establish an institutional arrangement of maritime VET from the women transport workers' career-cycle perspective. The paper concludes that the role of VET is important not only before the employment but also after, in order to make sustainable use of women as human resources. In order to remove barriers to including women in STEM careers, institutional arrangement of VET should be reviewed through gender-mainstreaming and life-long VET would help to stop the leaky pipe line of STEM women in Japan. © 2019 The Author(s)","Equal opportunities; Gender; Life-cycle career; Life-long learning; STEM careers; Transport industries; Vocational education and training (VET)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abumiya, M.I., Upper Secondary Education in Japan (2012), National Institute for Educational Policy Research Tokyo; Akai, G., Rika no jugyo ni arawareru jenda ni kansuru kenkyu [Studies on Gender in Science Classes] (1997) Annals of Educational Research, 43 (2), pp. 218-223; Becker, G.S., Human Capital: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, with Special Reference to Education (1993), University of Chicago Press Chicago; Belcher, P., Sampson, H., Thomas, M., Veiga, J., Zhao, M., Women Seafarers: Global Employment Policies and Practices (2003), ILO Geneva; BIMCO, ICS, Manpower Report: The Global Supply and Demand for Seafarers in 2015 (2016), Maritime International Secretariat Services Limited London; (2019), https://www.bloomberg.com/company/announcements/2019-bloomberg-gender-equality-index/, Bloomberg Finance LP. 2019.

Although women show great interest towards the different opportunities in the software industry and an increasing number of women are participating in the trainings and recruitment events - which usually are focused on recruiting more women to the software industry - there are still signs that gender bias is affecting the attitude climate in and about the industry. In this paper, the respondents' prejudices and attitudes towards the industry are analysed. The data is from an open internet survey collected in Finland during May-June 2018. The target group of the questionnaire was composed of women who are planning or have already made a career change to the software industry. The study shows that although the industry is attracting women, some of the respondents are suffering from low self-esteem and impostor syndrome when talking about their software engineering skills, as well as found the male-dominated industry sometimes challenging. © 2019 IEEE.","career change; gender bias; re-education; software industry; Women in STEM","Software engineering; Surveys; career change; Finland; Gender bias; Internet survey; Self esteem; Software industry; Target group; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Schweer, D., Sahl, J.C., The digital transformation of industry - The benefit for Germany (2017) The Drivers of Digital Transformation: Why There's No Way around the Cloud, pp. 23-31. , F.

However, only few studies investigate boys' and girls' perception of mother and father pressure/support in detail. This might be particularly essential when it comes to girls' and boys' achievement in STEM subjects, as girls and boys might profit differently from parental pressure/support regarding their achievement in STEM and vice versa. This study aims to shed light on this topic and explores potential within—and over time associations between students' perception of parental pressure/support and grades in mathematics and biology. Using self-report data from 1,088 8th grade students at T1 (Mage = 13.70, SD = 0.53, 54% girls) from Brandenburg, Germany, multigroup cross-lagged models were conceptualized with Mplus. The results indicate that there are gender differences in the interplay of students' grades in mathematics, biology, and their perception of parental pressure and support: Whereas, mother support plays a central beneficial role for girls' achievement in STEM subjects as well as for the other parental variables over time, for boys mother support is negatively associated with math performance over time. Within-time associations further show that boys—in contrast to girls—do not benefit from any parental support regarding their performance in mathematics or biology. Finally, results suggest that the relationship between adolescents' STEM achievement and parental pressure/support is rather mono-directional than bi-directional over time. © Copyright © 2019 Hoferichter and Raufelder.","gender; parental pressure; parental support; secondary school; STEM performance",,,,,,"Volkswagen Foundation: II/84 452","The research reported in this paper was supported by a grant from The Volkswagen Foundation (Schumpeter Fellowship II/84 452).

To place our investigation into a broader context, we compared students in STEM-L with students of STEM subjects with a medium proportion of women (STEM-M) as well as with other subjects with a medium or a high proportion of females. We analyzed their vocational interests, vocational aspirations and their interest congruence. In both the comparison regarding interest profiles and the comparison of vocational aspirations, we focused on the things-orientation and people-orientation, all while taking respective gender differences into account. Following the suggestion from previous studies, in a further step we differentiated between subjects within STEM-L. Using data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we analyzed the interest congruence of 5530 male and 7406 female students in STEM majors (with a low or medium proportion of women) and non-STEM majors (with a medium or high proportion of women). Students from different subjects showed different magnitudes regarding their things- and people-orientation. STEM-L students had a high things-orientation and a low people-orientation regarding both their interests and aspired occupations. Students of STEM-L and STEM-M showed a lower interest congruence than students from other subjects. With the exception of education, gender differences regarding the people- and things-orientation also existed within most of the subjects. Gender differences partly remain when distinguishing between the different subjects within STEM-L.

This article contributes to fill this gap by analysing Italian women’s entrepreneurship from the mid twentieth century to 2016. It is based on a new dataset concerning the profiles of the 80 women who were successful entrepreneurs and became Cavalieri del Lavoro (Knights of Labour), i.e. they were decorated with the Ordine al ‘Merito del Lavoro’ (Order of Merit for Labour), the highest recognition for achievements in the world of business in Italy. The dataset also includes a comparable sample of men who obtained the same award to single out the main similarities and differences between men and women entrepreneurs. This article employs a quantitative prosopographic approach: after presenting some descriptive statistics and some exemplary cases of successful women entrepreneurs, it uses cluster analysis to identify typological groups of women versus men entrepreneurs. The main results show that the institutional context and gender stereotypes slowed down the development of Italian women’s entrepreneurial abilities. Women entrepreneurs tend to cluster in family firms and to have become entrepreneurs by inheritance, whereas they have been handicapped in all other fields relevant to entrepreneurial success: access to education (especially STEM), managerial career, and experience abroad. Nonetheless, women entrepreneurs operated beyond women’s niches tied to the traditional ideology of femininity, e.g. textiles, garment and services. Several women operated in sectors such as chemicals and engineering in which many Italian industrial districts are specialised. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","history of entrepreneurship; Italy; prosopography; Women","entrepreneur; feminism; ideology; womens status; Italy",,,,,,"We would like to thank the participants to the ABH Conference ?The Human Factor in Business History?

Here we analyze the research output in terms of citations collected from the Web of Science of males and females from the largest Croatian university, University of Zagreb. Applying the Mann–Whitney statistical test, for most faculties, we demonstrate no gender difference in research output except for seven faculties, where males are significantly better than females on six faculties. We find that female STEM full professors are significantly more cited than male colleagues, while male non-STEM assistant professors are significantly more cited than their female colleagues. There are ten faculties where females have the larger average citations than their male colleagues and eleven faculties where the most cited researcher is woman. For the most cited researchers, our Zipf plot analyses demonstrate that both genders follow power laws, where the exponent calculated for male researchers is moderately larger than the exponent for females. The exponent for STEM citations is slightly larger than the exponent obtained for non-STEM citations, implying that compared to non-STEM, STEM research output leads to fatter tails and so larger citations inequality than non-STEM. © 2020 by the authors.

A firm conception of integrated STEM education is needed to determine its content, procedures and epistemological knowledge, the latter being the focus of this article. While epistemological accounts exist for its several disciplines, an integrated STEM epistemology has not yet emerged. This article provides a comparative analysis of modeling and argumentation in mathematics, science, and engineering and notes the observed similarities, intersections, and differences of their practice in these fields. Emphasis is given to the differences, which have not been elaborated in current literature although their importance has been noted. In this context, we examine definitions and functions of models and arguments in science and mathematics. The difference in argumentation concerns mainly the validation of knowledge; in models, the differences pertain to their constitution and intended aim. We also describe mathematical modeling, which optimally illustrates the interplay and collaboration of mathematics and science and permits comparison of their respective practices. The article contributes to the issue of the interrelated diversity of STEM practices and the intellectual and pragmatic educational benefits this issue confers. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Arguments in mathematics; Arguments in natural and engineering sciences; Mathematical modeling; Models/modeling in mathematics; Models/modeling in natural and engineering sciences; STEM epistemology",,,,,,,,,,,,,"(1993) Benchmarks for Science Literacy, , New York, Oxford University Press; Abd-El-Khalick, Examining the sources for our understanding about Science: Enduring conflations and critical issues in research on nature of science in science education (2012) International Journal of Science Education, 34 (3), pp. 353-374; Aberdein, Mathematics and Argumentation (2009) Foundations of Science, 14, pp. 1-8; Adúriz-Bravo, A., A ‘semantic’ view of scientific models for science education (2013) Science & Education, 17 (2-3), pp. 147-177; Adúriz-Bravo, A., Izquierdo-Aymerich, M., (2005) Utilizing the ‘3P-model’ to Characterize the Discipline of Didactics of Science.

We adopt a cross-country approach using Germany, Ireland, and Scotland as three case studies. These countries differ in terms of both the degree of subject choice offered in upper secondary education and the relevance for higher education admission of having studied specific school subjects. Using datasets of young people from all three countries, our results indicate a stronger mediation of school subjects for Scotland than in Germany and Ireland and a remarkable gender gap in STEM enrollment in all three countries. We conclude that females studying science subjects within upper secondary education appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition to ensure gender equality in progression to STEM fields. © The Author(s) 2020.","Curriculum; gender; Germany; higher education; Ireland; Scotland; segregation; STEM","educational development; gender discrimination; gender disparity; gender relations; higher education; secondary education; teaching; Germany; Ireland; Scotland; United Kingdom",,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC: ES/K006460/1","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was conducted within the research center AQMeN (Applied Quantitative Methods Network) and supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant No. ES/K006460/1).",,,,,,"Abbiss, J., Gendering the ICT curriculum: The paradox of choice (2009) Computers and Education, 53 (2), pp. 343-354; Ayalon, H., Livneh, I., Educational standardization and gender differences in mathematics achievement: A comparative study (2013) Social Science Research, 42 (2), pp. 432-445; Barone, C., Some things never change: Gender segregation in higher education across eight nations and three decades (2011) Sociology of Education, 84, pp. 157-176; Biewen, M., Schwerter, J., (2019) Does more math in high school increase the share of female STEM workers?

Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) are glass boxes introduced for extracting and understanding mindsets' structure (in Latin forma mentis) from textual data. Combining network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified relevant concepts in benchmark texts, without supervision. Once validated, TFMNs were applied to the case study of distorted mindsets about the gender gap in science. Focusing on social media, this work analysed 10,000 tweets mostly representing individuals' opinions at the beginning of posts. ``Gender'' and ``gap'' elicited a mostly positive, trustful and joyous perception, with semantic associates that: celebrated successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped for a future resolution. The perception of ``woman'' highlighted jargon of sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias) about women in science ``sacrificing personal skills for success''. The semantic frame of ``man'' highlighted awareness of the myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around ``person'', suggesting that tweets got less tense around genderless terms. No stereotypical perception of ``scientist'' was identified online, differently from real-world surveys. This analysis thus identified that Twitter discourse mostly starting conversations promoted a majorly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender disparity, aimed at closing the gap. Hence, future monitoring against discriminating language should focus on other parts of conversations like users' replies. TFMNs enable new ways for monitoring collective online mindsets, offering data-informed ground for policy making. © 2020 PeerJ Inc.","Cognition and language; Cognitive network science; Complex networks; Language modelling; Social computing; Social media; STEM education; Text mining","Semantics; Social networking (online); Female scientists; Gender disparity; Network science; Personal skills; Public perception; Sexual harassment; Stereotype threat; Women in science; Text mining",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aitchison, J., (2012) Words in the mind: An introduction to the mental lexicon, , Chichester, UK: John Wiley & Sons; Akimushkin, C., Amancio, D.R., Oliveira, O.N., Jr., Text authorship identified using the dynamics of word co-occurrence networks (2017) PLOS ONE, 12 (1); Amancio, D.R., Probing the topological properties of complex networks modeling short written texts (2015) PLOS ONE, 10 (2); Amancio, D.R., Oliveira, O.N., Jr., Costa, L.D.F., Structure-semantics interplay in complex networks and its effects on the predictability of similarity in texts (2012) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 391 (18), pp. 4406-4419; Beasley, A., Mason, W., Emotional states vs. emotional words in social media (2015) Proceedings of the ACM web science conference, pp. 1-10; Beede, D.N., Julian, T.A., Langdon, D., McKittrick, G., Khan, B., Doms, M.E., Women in STEM: A gender gap to innovation (2011) Economics and Statistics Administration Issue Brief, , (04-11); Bovet, A., Morone, F., Makse, H.A., Validation of Twitter opinion trends with national polling aggregates: Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump (2018) Scientific Reports, 8 (1), pp. 1-16; Cancho, R.F., Solé, R.V., Köhler, R., Patterns in syntactic dependency networks (2004) Physical Review E, 69 (5); Cancho, R.F.I., Solé, R.V., The small world of human language (2001) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Despite several studies showing the under-representation of women in STEM fields, few explore the factors that influence before entering and during the engineering studies, including the practices in the labor market. The support from the social context, such as family, friends, or teachers, can influence the attraction rates and dropout rates of the engineering studies. This paper presents a survey to analyze the gender and culture perceptions of supports in engineering studies, involving 208 female and male undergraduate students of engineering courses from Spain and Brazil. Some findings of this study show that the sample average (32.69%) followed the standard ratio of around 30% of women in STEM careers. Almost 70% of the female students decided to enroll in an engineering career during high school or vocational training courses. In Spain, the support of families and friends is higher than Brazil, but the support received from their academic institutions and teachers were low in both countries, regardless of gender. In the labor market, the male workers in Spain seem to be less supported than their female colleagues. © 2013 IEEE.","Engineering education; engineering gap; gender gap; quantitative analysis; survey; women studies","Commerce; Employment; Professional aspects; Students; Teaching; Technical presentations; Academic institutions; Attraction rate; Comparative studies; Engineering careers; Engineering course; Female students; Undergraduate students; Vocational training course; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"European Commission, EC: 598923-EPP-1-2018-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP; Erasmus+","This work was supported by Erasmus + Program of the European Union in its Key Action Two Capacity-Building in Higher Education through the Project Women into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, Building the Future of Latin America, Engaging Women into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, under Grant 598923-EPP-1-2018-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.",,,,,,"Powell, A., Dainty, A., Bagilhole, B., Gender stereotypes among women engineering and technology students in the UK: Lessons from career choice narratives (2012) Eur.

The present study examines differences in the meaning of work (i.e., their professional goal orientation) of students who are enrolled in STEM or non-STEM programs in tertiary education. Based on the background that gender stereotypes associate women and men with communal or agentic roles respectively, we expected that women in STEM subjects differ in their professional goal orientation from women in non-STEM programs. More precisely, women who are enrolled in a STEM major are expected to be less oriented to social and communal goal orientations than women in non-STEM university programs. In a sample of 5,857 second-year university students of the German National Educational Panel Study, three profiles of professional goal orientation were confirmed in a latent profile analysis. As expected, women were more oriented toward social aspects of occupations, whereas men more likely belonged to a profile with high importance for economic aspects of occupations. Moreover, students enrolled in STEM programs more likely belonged to the profile of economic goal orientation. There was, however, no interaction of gender and STEM program: Women in STEM fields did not differ in their occupational goal orientation from women enrolled in non-STEM programs. Based on these findings and on a goal congruity perspective, future interventions aiming at overcoming the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields should consider the individual meaning of work and the goals that are associated with STEM occupations. © Copyright © 2019 Wolter, Ehrtmann, Seidel and Drechsel.","gender stereotypes; goal orientation; latent profile analysis; meaning of work; STEM; university students",,,,,,"Leibniz-Gemeinschaft","Funding.

This problem persists despite numerous initiatives aimed at fostering the uptake of STEM subjects by women, who represent an underutilized source of talent in a time of great need for STEM professionals. Many reasons for women's avoidance of the path into STEM-related areas have been discussed, including weaker mathematical skills, implicit gender stereotypes or structural deficits in school education. One variable which is presumably at the core of decisions regarding a specific study subject is motivation. We aim to look in greater depth at the basis for motivation by referring to self-determination theory (SDT). Here, we specifically focus on the needs for competence and autonomy which represent pivotal sources of motivation, effective performance and psychological well-being and are assumed to be positively correlated with academic achievement and perseverance. In line with previous SDT research, we assume that self-perceptions during STEM studies contribute to experiences of competence and autonomy and may be responsible for gender disparities. To examine whether and how a sex-specific perception of autonomy and competence influences decisions regarding STEM subjects, we conducted a survey study of Master's students (N = 888; 461 female, 427 male), who were enrolled either in STEM or non-STEM subjects, and asked about students' motivations, perceived competence (e.g., self-efficacy) and autonomy (e.g., volitional decision for a study major). The results revealed several main effects of study major and only a small number of interaction effects of sex and subject. For example, non-STEM students were more likely to enroll due to their stronger interest in their subject, signifying higher autonomy, while STEM students were more likely to select their subject according to their families' wishes. The comparison between female and male STEM students revealed that males perceived more self-efficacy and reported more leadership aspirations while female STEM students have lower perceptions of their own competence, especially regarding perceived future competences. © 2019 Sobieraj and Krämer.","Autonomy; Competence; Gender; Motivation; STEM - science technology engineering mathematics",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abele, A.E., Stief, M., Andrä, M.S., Zur ökonomischen Erfassung beruflicher selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen-neukonstruktion einer BSW-Skala (2000) Zeitschrift für Arbeits-und Organisationspsychologie, 44, pp. 145-151; Amon, M.J., Looking through the glass ceiling: a qualitative study of STEM women's career narratives (2017) Front.

Many interventions aimed at addressing this issue have focused on young people aged 14+ years old. However, these interventions have resulted in little improvement in the numbers and diversity of young people progressing into STEM careers. The aim of this study is to ask “What are the affordances of a Theory of Change (ToC) for increasing the diversity and number of young people choosing a career in STEM post-18?” An innovative ToC is introduced which provides the theoretical underpinnings and context for the complex mix of interventions necessary to lead to a significant change in the number and diversity of those choosing STEM careers. Case studies of interventions developed using the ToC are presented.

The use of learning objects (activities and resources) offered by LMS means that both teachers and students require training. In addition, gender differences relating to the number of students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and Non-STEM courses might have some influence on the use of those learning objects. The study involves 13 teachers (6 experts in e-Learning and 7 non-experts) on 13 academic courses (4 STEM and 9 Non-STEM) and a detailed examination of the logs of 626 students downloaded from the Moodle platform. Our objectives are: (1) To confirm whether significant differences may be found in relation to the use of learning objects (resources and activities) on Moodle, depending on the expertise of the teacher (expert vs. non-expert in e-Learning); (2) To confirm whether there are significant differences between students regarding their use of learning objects, depending on the expertise of the teacher (expert vs. non-expert in e-Learning); (3) To confirm whether there are significant differences for the use of learning objects among students as a function of gender. Differences were found in the use of Moodle learning objects (resources and activities) for teachers and for students depending on the expertise of the teacher. Likewise, differences were found for the use of some learning objects as a function of gender and the degrees that the students were following. Increased technological training for both teachers and students is proposed, especially on Non-STEM qualifications, in order to mitigate the effects of the technological gap and its collateral relation with the gender gap and the digital divide. © 2021 by the authors.

To understand how these country variations come about, this study analyzes the gender gap in adolescents’ STEM expectations. While previous research mainly focused on the role of the cultural environment and the education system, this study contributes to the literature by investigating the opportunity structures of the labor market. We study how employment opportunities in science and technology, the post-industrial restructuring of labor markets in both low- and high-status occupations, and women's success in graduating from STEM fields might explain the gender gap in STEM expectations. Empirically, we analyze 15-year-old pupils’ occupational expectations from the OECD's PISA 2015 study linked with macro-level indicators in 35 EU and OECD countries by means of two-step multilevel models. Results indicate that the gender gap in STEM expectations is larger in countries with a more pronounced post-industrial restructuring of the labor market. However, rather than steering girls away from the STEM sector, post-industrial restructuring increases boys’ STEM expectations and thus seems to strengthen their gender-typical tasks preferences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","gender; labor markets; Occupational expectations; post-industrial restructuring; STEM","adolescent; article; child; controlled study; education; employment; expectation; female; human; human experiment; job market; male; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; sex difference",,,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: KL 2368/2; Sixth Framework Programme, FP6: 312691","The research leading to these results has received support under the European Commission?s 7th Framework Programme (FP7/2013?2017) under grant agreement n 312691, InGRID?Inclusive Growth Research Infrastructure Diffusion; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [grant number KL 2368/2].

Studies also acknowledge the role of informal learning in STEM achievement, mentioning the importance of student digital activities at home. However, the existing studies have not examined in detail the relationship between students’ engagement in specific technology-based activities at home and STEM achievement, and whether this relationship varies depending on student gender and parental education. Purpose: This study explores the relationship between students’ engagement in technology-based activities at home and STEM school achievement, and the possible moderating role of gender and parental education in this relationship. Sample: Participants in the study are 1,205 students (580 girls) attending fifth (n = 567) and sixth grades (n = 638) in 16 primary schools in Zagreb, Croatia. For each student, one of their parents also participated in the study, by completing questionnaires for parents. Methods: Students completed questionnaires containing questions assessing the frequency of various technology-based activities at home, and their STEM school achievement was assessed by objective paper-pencil tests. Results: The frequency of writing posts on social media sites and downloading music, movies, games or software from the internet negatively predicted STEM achievement, even after controlling for parental education and student gender. The relationship between frequency of certain technology-based activities at home and STEM achievement was found to vary depending on student gender and the combination of student gender and parental education. Conclusions: Although the frequency of certain activities at home is related to STEM achievement, the general conclusion is that engagement in technology-based activities at home does not substantially contribute to STEM achievement. Additionally, the relationship between technology-based activities and STEM achievement may differ for boys and girls, and for students with parents of different education levels. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","primary school; school achievement; STEM; technology-based activities",,,,,,"Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ: IP-09-2014-9250","Croatian Science Foundation Grant ?IP-09-2014-9250?STEM career aspirations during primary schooling: A cohort-sequential longitudinal study of relations between achievement, self-competence beliefs, and career interests (JOBSTEM).",,,,,,"Ahn, J., The Effect of Social Network Sites on Adolescents Social and Academic Development: Current Theories and Controversies (2011) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 62 (8), pp. 1435-1445; Archer, A., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., ´science Capital´: A Conceptual, Methodological, and Empirical Argument for Extending Bourdieusian Notions of Capital beyond the Arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (7), pp. 922-948; Archer, L., Dewitt, J., Willis, B., Adolescent Boys’ Science Aspirations: Masculinity, Capital and Power (2014) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51 (1), pp. 1-30; Archer, L., DeWitt, J., Osborne, J., Dillon, J., Willis, B., Wong, B., Balancing Acts Elementary School Girls’ Negotiations of Femininity, Achievement, and Science (2012) Science Education, 96 (6), pp. 967-989; Arroyo, I., Burleson, W., Tai, M., Muldner, K., Woolf, B.P., Gender Differences in the Use and Benefit of Advanced Learning Technologies for Mathematics (2013) Journal of Educational Psychology, 105 (4), pp. 957-969; Attewell, P., Battle, J., Home Computers and School Performance (1999) The Information Society, 15, pp. 1-10; Attewell, P., Battle, J., Suazo-Garcia, B., Computers and Young Children: Social Benefit or Social Problem?

The possible differences between boys and girls, school stage, and rurality are analyzed. For this purpose, a sample of 404 participants between 13 and 18 years old were delivered a form with items from the Questionnaire on Opinions about Science, Technology, and Society. The responses were offered using a five-point Likert scale and agreement percentages were calculated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for the analysis, where the effect size was calculated for items associated with any of the three factors. Our findings show that the stereotyped ideas of gender in science were more intense in Compulsory Secondary Education (CSE) students in rural areas than in High School (HS) students from urban areas. In addition, perceptions of science and scientists showed greater agreement for CSE than for HS students. However, no differences were found between girls and boys. Regarding science items, there was a major agreement on the relationship between science and technology with problem solving, regardless of sex or school rurality. Finally, reflections on stereotypes and the presence of girls in STEM careers are provided. © 2020 by the authors.

Globally, more men are studying and working in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields than women. This imbalance is also the case in Nigeria. One contributor to this imbalance is stereotypical gender representation of scientists, mathematicians, engineers and technologists in popular media and career advertisement. Previous research indicates that stereotypes are also prevalent in educational materials used with young people. Given that the aspirations of young people are formed early in their educational journey, it is particularly pertinent to examine the gender bias in educational materials. As part of the DIGISTEM project, a World Bank-sponsored project in Nigeria, the aim of this study was to explore the level of gender bias in the images and language contained in the most frequently used science, technology, and mathematics textbooks recommended by the Nigerian Education Ministry. This study evaluated a total of 2116 visual and text references from 25 government recommended instructional materials. The analysis shows that males are significantly more represented in these resources than females. This study highlights that there is a stereotypical representation of scientists and engineers in primary school instructional materials as demonstrated by the imbalance portrayed in the examined textbooks. This paper concludes with an exploration of the implications of these findings on the educational sector and the need to provide a more inclusive approach to educational resources to enable young people to realise that STEM careers and subjects can be for people like them. This study took place in Nigeria; however, we recognise similar challenges and opportunities in a number of other jurisdictions which provides a foundation for replicability, portability and extension to this work. © 2020 IEEE.","Education; Gender; Nigeria; STEM; Stereotypes","Engineering education; Engineers; Professional aspects; Textbooks; Education ministries; Educational materials; Educational resource; Educational sectors; Gender stereotypes; Instructional materials; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Scientists and engineers; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,"The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Ekiti State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and Stemres Learning Initiative for this study.",,,,,,"About the Sustainable Development Goals-United Nations Sustainable Development, , https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/, United Nations [Accessed: 01-Apr-2019]; (2018) International Labour Office, Geneva; Atansah, J., Khandan, P., Moss, M., Mukherjee, T., Richmond, A., (2017) When Do Subsidy Reforms Stick Lessons from Iran, Nigeria, and India, , Washington, DC; Namadi, M.M., Aliyu, M.A., (2017) AN APPRAISAL of the IMPACT of SUBSIDY REINVESTMENT PROGRAM (SURE-P) on WOMEN EMPOWERMENT in KADUNA STATE; Nigeria economic recovery & growth plan 2017-2020 (2017) Ministry of Budget and National Planning, , Federal Republic of Nigeria; Puerta, M.L.S., Rizvi, A., Measuring skills demanded by employers : Skills toward employment and productivity (step) (2018) World Bank, , Washington, DC May; Islam, M., Akter, T., Knezevic, R., The role of moocs in achieving the sustainable development goal four (2019) Journal of Cleaner Production, , June; Ouda, H., Ahmed, K., Strategic future directions for developing stem education in higher education in Egypt as a driver of innovation economy (2016) J.

This is due to the various examinations and requirements that must be met to be qualified for admission among innumerable applicants. It is therefore imperative that after admission, students must pursue academic excellence to justify the opportunity given to them, and this will also improve their chances of success after graduation. In a university, some first-year students struggle because of cultural disadvantages, as well as their economic and social backgrounds. This has resulted in poor performance by some students and inevitably led to bad grades at graduation and some drop out of the university without graduating. Female students are often said to perform a bit poorer in terms of academic performance. This study is a comparative performance analysis of male and female students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), conducted using regression models. Trend analysis shows that in this case study, female students have a tendency to improve on their academic performance from their first to their final year. The highest R-squared value of 0.7069 was achieved based on a regression analysis of the performance of 1,093 female students. © 2020, Paulus Editora.

The profile is often operationalized as a mathematics- versus verbal-ability tilt. While the relationship between the tilt and a career choice is usually explained using concepts of gender-specific investments or comparative advantage, it is rarely considered that this relation is in fact causally reciprocal. In this article, we assume that investments in skill development and a set of considered educational options are interdependent, as students invest more time in subjects that seem more relevant to their plans, while the plans themselves are at least in part shaped by self-assessed cognitive strengths. The goal of this study is thus to estimate the magnitude of the direct impact of the mathematics- versus verbal-ability tilt on the educational choices that enable the pursuit of a STEM career, while accounting for endogeneity in this relationship. We employ the instrumental variable approach to data on the Polish high-stakes exit exams that serve as a de facto filter to particular majors in tertiary education. The analysis covers the 2018 population of senior-year students (mostly 19-year-olds) taking the exit exams in all 5323 Polish high schools. The results reveal that ability tilt is as important in explaining students' choices of further educational paths as their level of mathematical ability and accounts for much of the gender gap in pursuing STEM majors. Methodologically, we point out that the results are substantially different from those estimated without taking into account school effects and the endogeneity of ability and choice. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Abilities; Endogeneity; Exam; Gender gap; STEM; Tilt",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cameron, A.C., Triverdi, P.K., Microeconometrics methods and applications (2008), 2008. , Cambridge university press Cambridge; Contini, D., Di Tommaso, M.L., Mendolia, S., The gender gap in mathematics achievement: evidence from Italian data (2017) Economics of Education Review, 58, pp. 32-42; Coyle, T.R., Purcell, J.M., Snyder, A.C., Richmond, M.C., Ability tilt on the SAT and ACT predicts specific abilities and college majors (2014) Intelligence, 46, pp. 18-24; Coyle, T.R., Snyder, A.C., Richmond, M.C., Sex differences in ability tilt: support for investment theory (2015) Intelligence, 50, pp. 209-220; Dicke, A.L., Safavian, N., Eccles, J.S., Traditional gender role beliefs and career attainment in STEM: a gendered story?

Findings on indicators of girl’s achievement in STEM education at the secondary level in Poland show gender imbalance, but Poland is doing better than some countries. With regard to STEM occupations, Poland is among the countries with the lowest representation of women. Country level socio-economic, cultural and political factors including GNP, number of women in Parliament, gender inequality, overall equality, and religion are examined as possible factors associated with these trends in Poland and elsewhere. Detailed Polish data are used to provide additional insights into girls’ and women’s access to STEM education and ultimately occupations in Poland. The Polish data show areas for improvement but also areas of success. The research is placed in the context of Poland’s unique historical, cultural, political, and socio-economic arrangements. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cross-national; Gender; Poland; STEM education; STEM occupations",,,,,,,"This work was in part funded by a 2018 U.S./Poland Fulbright grant to Sandra Hanson for work at the Department of Sociology, Jagiellonian University, in Krakow, Poland.","This work was in part funded by a 2018 U.S./Poland Fulbright grant to Sandra Hanson for work at the Department of Sociology, Jagiellonian University, in Krakow, Poland.

This article reports on a 3-year study examining the barriers to career advancement for women/women of color tenure-line Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) faculty at a large public comprehensive minority-serving university. We aimed to understand institutional policies and practices, and compared the perceptions and actions of 3 constituent groups: Deans, STEM faculty, and members of the university tenure and promotion committee. Specifically, we examined tenured and tenure-track STEM faculty perceptions and experiences with institutional service in an effort to understand how these align or diverge among gendered and racial groups and among 3 constituent groups of institutional actors to uncover tensions that arise with formal and informal service policies and activities. Findings are based on a faculty survey conducted to gather descriptive information about the role of service in tenure-line STEM faculty careers and faculty perceptions of their work-load and value of these activities, in-depth interviews with university deans and members of the University Tenure & Promotion Committee (UTPC), and focus groups with STEM tenure-line women faculty. We found 3 institutional and service-related barriers to career advancement: (a) inequitable distribution of service with no reward; (b) devaluing of service by the university; and (c) lack of clarity and consistency about the role of service in the retention, tenure, and promotion (RTP) processes. Further, embedded in these barriers were experiences of gendered and racist stereotypes and inequities shaping and intersecting with the identified barriers. The study suggests institutional changes to make high impact service activities more visible, equitably distributed, and valued in the tenure and promotion process at this large public, comprehensive minority-serving institution. © 2020 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.","Gender and racial inequity; Institutional barriers; Service; STEM; Women faculty",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Domingo, C.R.",,,"American Psychological Association",,,,,19388926,,,,"English","J.

These initiatives are designed for institutions to contribute to increasing the proportion of women in computer science by using robots. Through applying these initiatives, institutions such as computer science faculties can help to reduce the gender imbalance, increase diversity and the amount of computer science specialists, who are requested immensely. Based on the results of conducted requirements elicitation a concept for programming an application with the NAO robot which trains vocabularies, as well as a concept with the Cozmo robot which piles up cubes, were developed. First tests were performed with female and male high school students. Either concept consists of an introduction of possible robotics application fields, a presentation explaining the Python program code of the concept as well as corresponding exercises with the robot and Python. Evaluation of the workshop concepts through questionnaires showed that both concepts have the potential to increase the proportion of women and to motivate female as well as male students for computer science. Moreover, recommendations for further robotics projects with respect to motivating young women for STEM can be made based on the insights of the requirements elicitation and the evaluation of the concepts. Nevertheless, further refinement and validation has to be undertaken. Long-term as well as short-term initiatives are feasible with the developed concepts. All participating schools showed high interest in both types of initiatives and further cooperation. © 2020 Kassel University Press GmbH.

This paper proposes a model for pragmatic ex ante evaluation using an innovative conceptual framework for practitioners working in the field to improve gender equality in research and innovation. The presented and applied model is pertinent to the theory-oriented evaluation tradition using a logic frame and a theory of change approach adapted to the special requirements of ex-ante evaluation. The model is illustrated by the case study of a program for the promotion of women entrepreneurship in the STEM fields. It is concluded that in a setting with limited resources and information, ex-ante evaluations should aim at defining clear conditions of proportionality and need to take into account the extent to which contextual factors hinder or facilitate the implementation of a program, and the specific institutional and system mechanisms at play, in order to enable proactive risk management from the beginning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Evaluation framework; Ex-ante evaluation; Gender equality programs; Research and innovation; Women entrepreneurs; Women start-ups","conceptual framework; entrepreneur; gender issue; innovation; risk assessment; social theory; womens employment; adult; article; conceptual framework; entrepreneurship; female; gender; human; logic; male; physician; risk management; theoretical study; education; organization; organization and management; prevention and control; program development; program evaluation; sexism; technology; Entrepreneurship; Female; Humans; Organizational Innovation; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Sexism; Technology; Women",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 710470; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020","The research article presents results of various case studies that were undertaken as part of the EFFORTI Project (Evaluation Framework for Promoting Gender Equality in Research and Innovation).

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents data from a survey on female STEM students’ “Perspectives of women in STEM”, “Parents’ Science qualification”, “Supports in their STEM Course” and their “Science identify” through a social capital lens. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to analyse the data. Findings: The main findings were that female STEM undergraduates believe social bias, balancing work and family life and lack of role models are the main cause of less women in STEM professions and leadership positions. There were statistically significant differences between how male and female students identified with certain traits, with less females claiming to be intelligent and know about latest discoveries than males. Research limitations/implications: To eradicate stereotypical views of scientists, it is recommended that Irish higher-education institutions introduce initiatives to increase the socialisation of STEM females within female networks and develop female students’ self-awareness of their own capabilities. The expansion of STEM networks could act as a means to facilitate female students adopting positive science identities, increasing their science capital. Originality/value: In Ireland, there is a paucity of literature relating to females’ experience of STEM in higher education. This paper provides evidence that despite their engagement with STEM, female undergraduate students subscribe to the stereotypical image of the scientist. This study highlights the need to change the culture experienced by female STEM undergraduates in Ireland so as to improve the experiences and trajectories of women in higher education. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Culture; Gender; Identity; STEM",,,,,,"Johnson and Johnson, J&J","This research received funding from the Johnson and Johnson WiSTEM2D Programme (College and University Talent).

But recent work has offered a unifying explanation for gender representation across the STEM/non-STEM divide. This proposed explanation, called the field-specific ability beliefs (FAB) hypothesis, postulates that, in combination with pervasive stereotypes that link men but not women with intellectual talent, academics perpetuate female underrepresentation by transmitting to students in earlier stages of education their beliefs about how much intellectual talent is required for success in each academic field. This theory was supported by a nationwide survey of U.S. academics that showed both STEM and non-STEM fields with fewer women are also the fields that academics believe require more brilliance. We test this top-down schema with a nationwide survey of U.S. undergraduates, assessing the extent to which undergraduate beliefs about talent in academia mirror those of academics. We find no evidence that academics transmit their beliefs to undergraduates. We also use a second survey “identical to the first but with each field's gender ratio provided as added information” to explicitly test the relationship between undergraduate beliefs about gender and talent in academia. The results for this second survey suggest that the extent to which undergraduates rate brilliance as essential to success in an academic field is highly sensitive to this added information for non-STEM fields, but not STEM fields. Overall, our study offers evidence that, contrary to FAB hypothesis, the STEM/non-STEM divide principally shapes undergraduate beliefs about both gender and talent in academia. © Copyright © 2019 Bailey, Horacek, Worthington, Nanthakumar, Preston and Ilie.","gender bias; gender stereotypes; STEM; STEM/non-STEM divide; talent; underrepresentation of women; women in science",,,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; Harvard University; State University of New York Oswego","This work was supported by a Student Mini Grant from State University of New York at Oswego and a U.S. Student Fulbright grant.","We thank Charin Smith of Oswego, NY, USA, Melissa Schmitz of Le Moyne College, NY, USA, additional members of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University, the Biostatistics Department at Harvard University, Christian Meisel of the National Institute of Mental Health and the reviewers.

Less is known about the factors that explain gendered patterns of participation in STEM in countries with dissimilar national characteristics and educational systems. To fill this gap in the literature, this study first examines the historical trends of female representation in STEM fields cross-nationally. Then, this paper explores the relationship between women’s and men’s enrollments in STEM with various structural, national characteristics. Recognizing that the relationship may vary by subfields of STEM, the study further investigates the association separately for natural science and for engineering. Using time-and entity-fixed effects panel regression models pooled between 1970 and 2010, the study’s analyses built on earlier studies on gender segregation across fields of study and gender inequality in higher education. The findings suggest that the common assumption of tight, positive linkage between societal development and participation in STEM holds for only men at an aggregate level under the period covered. The authors find a negative association between national economic development and women’s participation in STEM, especially for engineering. On the other hand, they find positive associations between men’s enrollment in STEM as well as women’s enrollment in other fields of study with women’s participation in STEM. Taken together, the results suggest the significance of the diffusion of an inclusive logic in higher educational institutions. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Cross-national study; Fixed effects; Gender inequality; Gender segregation; Higher education; Women in STEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arum, R., Gamoran, A., Shavit, Y., (2007) Stratification in Higher Education: A Comparative Study, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Baker, D., (2014) The Schooled Society: The Educational Transformation of Global Culture, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Baker, D.P., Jones, D.P., Creating gender equality: Cross-national gender stratification and mathematical performance (1993) Sociology of Education, 66 (2), pp. 91-103; Barone, C., Some things never change: Gender segregation in higher education across eight nations and three decades (2011) Sociology of Education, 84 (2), pp. 157-176; Beasley, M.A., Fischer, M.J., Why they leave: The impact of stereotype threat on the attrition of women and minorities from science, math and engineering majors (2012) Social Psychology of Education, 15, pp. 427-448; Berkovitch, N., (1999) From Motherhood to Citizenship: Women’s Rights and International Organizations, , Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press; Berkovitch, N., Bradley, K., The globalization of women’s status: Consensus/dissensus in the world polity (1999) Sociological Perspectives, 42 (3), pp. 481-498; Boaler, J., Reclaiming school mathematics: The girls fight back (1997) Gender and Education, 9 (3), pp. 285-305; Boserup, E., Tan, S.F., Toulmin, C., (2013) Woman’s Role in Economic Development, , London: Routledge; Bradley, K., The incorporation of women into higher education: Paradoxical outcomes?

The study also explores whether learners belonging to different subgroups benefit more from the use of serious games than their peers. The subgroups are formed based on learner demographics that capture learners' attitude toward school or STEM subjects, their previous educational performance and gender. Background: Despite the latest rapid economy growth in the ICT sector, many European countries are facing the challenge of retaining students in STEM-related subjects, which could lead to unfilled vacancies in the ICT job markets in the near future. Serious games have been utilized in the classrooms of many STEM subjects to improve students' learning experience and learning outcomes, and potentially encourage their engagement with STEM-related industries. While some prior works had assessed the effectiveness of serious games in improving students' learning outcomes, little research has been done to investigate the impacts among students with different previous educational background and performance, attitude, and gender. Research Questions: 1) Do the proposed serious games improve students' learning outcomes? and 2) Do students with certain previous educational performance, learning attitude, and/or gender benefit more than others from the use of serious games? Methodology: To thoroughly study students' learning outcome, a large-scale pilot was deployed as part of the first-year undergraduate C Programming module at Dublin City University, Ireland. A multidimensional pedagogical assessment toolkit was utilized. In particular, a demographic questionnaire was carried out before the pilot began, based on which students were divided into different subgroups in terms of educational ability, initial attitude to school, attitude toward learning STEM subjects, and gender. Pre- and post-tests were conducted right before and after playing each game. For students belonging to each subgroup and for all students, the average pre- and post-test marks related to each game were compared, while paired-sample $t$ -tests were also conducted to assess the statistical significance of knowledge gain. Findings: Statistically significant knowledge gains were observed in all three games for all students. The students with good previous educational performance or strong attitude toward attending school and learning STEM subjects, tend to gain more by using serious games, as they obtained statistically significant improved learning outcomes in all three games. The students with average starting points, although performed better in the post-test than in the pretest in all games, they achieved statistically significant improvements in some cases only. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Knowledge assessment; programming; serious games; STEM education; technology-enhanced learning","Population statistics; Serious games; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Dublin City University; Educational performance; European Countries; Learning attitudes; Paired-sample t-test; Programming course; Statistical significance; Students' learning experiences; Students",,,,,"Science Foundation Ireland, SFI: 13/RC/2094; Horizon 2020: 688503","Manuscript received June 15, 2020; revised October 12, 2020; accepted December 6, 2020.

However, attitudes toward such initiatives can be negative. In two experiments with STEM academics, we examined how GEIs can be best framed to improve attitudes toward them. In study 1 (N = 113), we manipulated the framing of GEI leadership (led by a man or woman) and GEI focus (benefitting men and women or benefitting women only). The men were more supportive of GEIs benefitting both men and women because of fewer concerns of unfair treatment and more internal motivations to engage with GEIs. The women's level of support was unaffected by framing. In study 2 (N = 151), we framed GEIs as either supported by university management or not and either internally or externally driven. Support was greater for internally driven GEIs. The impact of management support depended on the academics' experience with GEIs. This research makes evidence-based recommendations for the implementation of GEIs to improve their effectiveness. © 2020 The Author(s).

Girls perceive themselves to be significantly worse than boys in mathematics and report higher test anxiety toward mathematics exams. Gender differences in self-efficacy become more pronounced as students grow up, and test anxiety increases for all students. However, the present study shows that teachers' do not perceive differences in self-efficacy in mathematics between boys and girls. Background: The low presence of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) might be explained by the attitude of young students toward mathematics. Different studies show that girls are less interested in STEM areas than boys during secondary school. A study on the reasons for this fact pointed out that the early years of education can provide a relevant insight to reverse the situation. Research Questions: Is there any age-dependent gender difference in primary school students in aspects related to mathematics? Are teachers aware of students' perceptions? Methodology: This work presents a study of over 2000 primary school students (6-12 years old) and 200 teachers in Aragón (Spain). The study consists of a survey on aspects that influence the experience of female and male students with mathematics and Spanish language for comparison purposes and teacher's awareness of students' perception. Findings: The present study shows that during primary school, girls are more likely to experiment a negative attitude toward mathematics than boys as they grow up, and teachers may not perceive girls' situation. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","and mathematics (STEM) studies; engineering; Mathematics; primary school; science; technology; women in engineering","Students; Cross-sectional study; Gender differences; Primary schools; Self efficacy; Teachers'; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"10/2ACT; European Commission, EC: 2017-EU-IA-0167, 765121; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: FCT-18-13481; Universidad de Zaragoza; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER: PID2019-105660RB-C21, RTI2018-096986-B-C31, T45-17R, T60-20R, TIN2016-76635-C2-1-R; Gobierno de Aragón; Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI; Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología, FECYT","Manuscript received October 10, 2019; revised April 24, 2020; accepted June 13, 2020.

Dimensional comparison theory proposes that these beliefs are themselves affected by students comparing their ability across different domains. However, only a few studies have aimed to integrate these approaches and clarify the role of dimensional comparisons within EVT. Using longitudinal data, we aimed to fill this gap by studying within- and cross-domain effects of achievement (grades and test scores), academic self-concept (as a surrogate for expectancy beliefs), and values on German adolescents’ (N = 519) high school course choices and their intentions to major in a STEM subject at university. We show that (a) self-concepts predicted course choices, whereas values predicted STEM study intentions; (b) dimensional comparison patterns (positive within-domain and negative across-domain relations) were present; (c) gender differences in course choices were mediated by differences in achievement, self-concept, and value; and (d) there was an incremental gender effect on STEM study intentions above and beyond achievement, self-concept, value, and previous course choices. Furthermore, overall, a model incorporating cross-domain paths representing dimensional comparisons fit the data better than a model without these paths. We conclude that direct and indirect dimensional comparison effects contribute to predicting choices of high school courses and university majors and to understanding gender differences in these choices. We recommend that studies in the EVT framework include cross-domain effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Educational Impact and Implications Statement—We show that students’ domain-specific self-concepts (i.e., their self-perceived ability in a domain) and values (e.g., their enjoyment and interest in a domain) are related to their choices and intentions (expectancy-value theory). When making course choices, students’ self-perceived ability seems to play a major role, whereas intentions regarding the domain of study after graduation are more strongly related to the values students ascribe to different domains. Furthermore, our study emphasizes that, when choosing advanced courses or forming study intentions, students consider their achievement, self-concept, and value in several domains, thus weighting their strengths and weaknesses against each other (dimensional comparison theory). Our results may be important for educators who counsel students about their course and postschool choices. The assumed processes (i.e., differences in self-concept and value) partly, but not fully, explain gender differences in STEM study intentions, indicating a need for further research.

We use national statistical data on the gender and countryorigin of universities’ teaching and research staff between 2012 and 2018 to study how the globalized academic labor market has influenced the proportion of women across career stages, with a special focus on STEM fields. We pay special attention to how gender and country‐origin are interrelated in universities’ academic career hierarchies. The findings show that the proportion of foreign‐born teaching and research staff rose substantially at the lower career level (grade C positions) in the 2010s. The increase was more modest among the most prestigious grade A positions, such as professorships. The findings show significant national differences in how gender and country‐origin of staff intersect in Nordic universities. The study contributes to research on the gendered patterns of global academic labor markets and social stratification in Nordic universities. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).","Academic labor markets; Country‐origin; Gender; Global labor markets; Intersectionality; Nordic universities; Social stratification; Universities",,,,,,"80713; Norges Forskningsråd","This work is part of the Nordic Centre for Research on Gender Equality in Research and Innovation (NORDICORE).

In upper secondary education, a distinct flexible course structure with multiple options was introduced in order to enhance school effectiveness and equity. This study departs in some of the previously outlined tensions in educational research between market interests and a ‘free choice discourse’ in relation to processes of differentiation. The purpose of this article is to investigate the ways gender patterns may be reproduced in relation to the emergence of multiple options and the re-organization of subject matters within Swedish upper secondary science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Our case addresses relations between discourses of choice and gender articulated in policy incentives, and large-scale enrolment patterns. Our results show how multiple options reproduce gender orders by 1) changing the system in accordance with a general market logic emphasizing ‘freedom of choice’, and 2) distinguishing predominantly gendered subject matters. Also, our results point to the importance of studying the STEM domain at a non-aggregated level to further understand the mechanisms behind gender gaps in STEM education. © 2019 The Author(s).

It includes two studies. In Study 1, 473 gifted girls from eight high schools in Taiwan participated, and, based on a self-reported survey, the results indicated 52.5% possessed neutral characteristics and it also implied that they simultaneously possessed masculine and feminine characteristics. Meanwhile, the higher the social gender-role awareness and career self-efficacy, the better was that individual’s career development. However, when compared to gifted girls in language/social sciences, the career self-efficacy and career development of STEM gifted girls was significantly lower. Later, 70 gifted girls continually participated in Study 2, on a voluntary basis. We found that although STEM gifted girls had their own goals and direction when it came to universities, the higher they are in the education stage, the lower the career self-efficacy and lower science learning interest they may have. This would have a certain degree of impact on their subsequent career development. Thus, a well-designed career program and mentorship for gifted girls are needed to address the current issue. © 2019 European Council for High Ability.","career development; career self-efficacy; gender role; Gifted girls in math/science",,,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, MOST: 101-2120-S-002-001-","This work was supported by the The Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 101-2120-S-002-001-].",,,,,,"Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84, pp. 191-215; Bem, S.L., (1981) Bem sex role inventory: Professional manual, , Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press; Betz, N.E., Hackett, G., Applications of self-efficacy theory to understanding career choice behavior (1986) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 4, pp. 279-289; Betz, N.E., Hackett, G., Applications of self efficacy theory to the career assessment of women (1997) Journal of Career Assessment, 5, pp. 383-402; Broderick, P.C., Blewitt, P., (2010) The life span: Human development for helping professionals, , 3rd, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, &, ed; Chen, C.P., Wong, J., Career counseling for gifted students (2013) Australian Journal of Career Development, 22, pp. 121-129; Corwith, S., Olszewski-Kubilius, P., Academic planning for gifted students (2012) Handbook for counselors serving students with gifts and talents, pp. 477-493. , Cross T.L., Cross J.R., (eds), Waco, TX: Prufrock Press, &,.

But how to create more female entrepreneurs in STEM industries (STEMpreneurs)? The German university Hochschule Fresenius has developed a project, named PANDA, which connects established companies of the STEM industry and their business ideas with students of STEM study paths. The target of PANDA is to enable companies to innovate like a startup and on the other hand to inspire students of STEM study paths to become an entrepreneur. Caused by the discussion about female influences and the small share of female entrepreneurs in STEM industries this study has the motivation to analyze if an approach like PANDA can contribute to increase the share of female entrepreneurs in STEM industries. This is achieved through the description of the approach in the context of the Open Innovation framework and the analysis of the share of female students (42 %) in 9 executed PANDA projects. © 2020 IEEE.","cooperative innovation; female entrepreneurs; innovation; PANDA approach; STEM industries","Students; Business idea; Female entrepreneurs; Female students; Open innovation; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Liao, Y., Zhao, H., The moderating effect of entrepreneurship orientation on new product innovation performance (2020) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL of BUSINESS, 25 (2); Dorr, N., Muller-Prothmann, T., (2014) Innovationsmanagement: Strategien, Methoden und Werkzeuge fur Systematische Innovationsprozesse, , Munchen: Hanser; Kuschel, K., Women entrepreneurship within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields (2017) Special Issue of the International Entrepreneurship and Management Journal; Kollmann, T., Deutscher startup monitor 2019 (2019) Bundesverband Deutsche Startups E.

Using data from Switzerland, we compare students who have self-selected into a STEM specialization with students who have self-selected into a language specialization. Our identification exploits the random assignment of students to classrooms after they have chosen their specialization. In contrast to the average effects found in previous studies, we find a negative effect of the proportion of female peers in the classroom on math grades for girls who have self-selected into the STEM specialization and a positive effect for girls who have self-selected into a language specialization.

The dataset (591 students and 316,974 actions) was obtained from the ASSISTments project. In the ASSISTments intelligent tutoring system, students completed mathematical problem-solving tasks, and the data was processed to infer their action-level affective states and behaviors, which were averaged to form student-level measures. The students' future STEM choice was predicted by the student- and action-level affective states and behaviors using logistic regression (LR), ordinary least squares regressions with standardized scores (ORz), and random forest with permutation importance and SHAP values (RFPS). The results revealed that student- and action-level gaming behavior consistently predict STEM choice. In addition to gaming, female students are more likely to study STEM if they are less bored and more off-task, and male students if more concentrated and less frustrated. ORz generates theoretically plausible results and identifies sufficiently distinguishable affective states and behaviors.

However, research is missing on peer influence. This topic seems especially crucial in programs for adolescents as peer influence plays an important role at this age. In our study, we investigated peer influence on mentoring outcomes – confidence in own STEM abilities and STEM-related activities – in an online mentoring program in STEM for secondary school girls (N = 124, M = 14.3 years, SD = 2.2 years, age range: 11–19 years). The program provides girls with at least 1 year of one-on-one interaction with a personal female mentor who has a college degree in a STEM subject. Participants can also interact with other participants on the platform. We used a longitudinal social network analysis approach to examine peer influence on mentoring outcomes. Our results indicate that both mentoring outcomes – mentees’ confidence in own STEM abilities and STEM-related activities – are influenced by peers moderated by the mentees’ own age. Younger mentees tended to become more similar to their peers regarding confidence in own STEM abilities and STEM-related activities, whereas older mentees tended to become more dissimilar over time. In addition, peer group size had a positive effect on confidence in own STEM abilities, but not on STEM-related activities. This effect was moderated by the mentee’s age. Overall, peers have a positive influence on the measured mentoring outcomes, especially for young mentees. © Copyright © 2020 Hopp, Stoeger and Ziegler.","online mentoring; peer influence; RSiena; social network analysis; STEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aral, S., Walker, D., Creating social contagion through viral product design: a randomized trial of peer influence in networks (2011) Manage.

Seventeen young people, either enrolled in university studies or working in the private STEM sector, were interviewed. Drawing on the factors influencing teaching–choice theory, the results suggest certain similarities and differences between male and female participants. Male participants’ intrinsic values associated the decision to follow STEM studies with specific objects that had attracted them since childhood, while women’s interests revolved around the techniques and processes associated with their specific STEM field. Whereas women emphasized the extent to which their career decisions were based on teachers’ encouragement, men emphasized the role of family tradition and mass media. Social utility values associated with the STEM field were important for women, whereas men stressed attainment of personal values. There were no gender differences in the task return–related values associated with choosing an STEM career. © Curators of the University of Missouri 2018.","expectancies; gender differences; motivations; STEM; values",,,,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The present Research was funded by Fundaci?n Telef?nica.",,,,,,"Diekman, A.B., Brown, E., Johnston, A., Clark, E., Seeking congruity between goals and roles: A new look at why women opt out of STEM careers (2010) Psychological Science, 21, pp. 1051-1057; Diekman, A.B., Steinberg, M., Navigating social roles in pursuit of important goals: A communal goal congruity account of STEM pursuits (2013) Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 7, pp. 487-501; Eccles, J.S., Studying gender and ethnic differences in participation in math, physical science, and information technology (2005) New Directions in Child and Adolescent Development, 110, pp. 7-14; Eccles, J.S., Who am I and what am I going to do with my life?

The low participation percentage of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) studies has been identified as one of the main problems that must be resolved in order to close the gender gap that exists in the technology sector. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of professional competences on the selection of university studies according to the absence or presence of masculinization factors in those studies. Mechanical engineering competences, both generic and transversal, and competence acquisition methods, are classified into 'care' (feminine) or 'provisions' (masculine) concepts. After the competence analysis, it can be concluded that explicit engineering curricula are focused on ""provisions"", which translates into a cultural perception of industrial engineering as a male profession. After a professional competence analysis in engineering studies at The University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), our study identified a relationship between the masculinization factors included in professional competences and the selection of university studies. This paper presents working actions towards the incorporation of a gender perspective into the degree in mechanical engineering at the UPV/EHU. © 2020 by the authors.","Engineering; Gender; Professional competences; University","data acquisition; engineering; gender discrimination; gender relations; higher education; perception; university sector; womens status; Basque Country [Spain]; Spain",,,,,"Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea, EHU: EHU12/26, S-PE11UN112","Acknowledgments: Thanks are addressed to PIE (Educational Innovation Projects) program of the University of the Basque Country for their support via 2018–2019 call.

We combine survey data on Swiss university graduates with rich municipality level information. We use a principal component analysis to construct an indicator capturing progressive attitudes in a student's home environment. Our structural approach allows directly comparing the importance of sociocultural background with that of pecuniary returns and costs in the choice of college major. Identification exploits individual differences in the relative cost of studying STEM that are unrelated to the local economic environment. Male students from conservative backgrounds are more likely to study STEM, whereas women are unaffected by sociocultural background besides majority language. The effect of the progressivism indicator for males is about half of the effect of the earnings return to STEM and twice as large as the effect of the relative monetary cost. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

Museums need to become permanent spaces dedicated to problems of gender equality, advocate for changes that promote gender equality internally and externally and become acknowledged on local and national level as trusted organisations that bring together stakeholders and advocate for a more gender inclusive society. They need to serve as permanent places where questions around gender and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are addressed on different levels. To this end, 14 science centres and museums in Europe and Israel worked together for three years as part of a common, European-funded project (Hypatia) in order to become Hubs for gender equality in their communities. Together, they created synergies, working with schools, industry and research centres as agents of change. At the end of the project, they listed a series of recommendations for the long-term implementation of Gender inclusion in STEM communication. They based these recommendations on the findings of the Horizon 2020 funded project ‘Hypatia’ in which they collaborated from 2015 until 2018, on their own experiences, and shared learning. Participating museums selected four places and sectors in which they planned to implement changes, thereby ensuring their actions would be sustainable: their own museum/science centre/network of science centres; research and industry institutions; schools; and within other informal science education organisations. Using tools developed by the project, including a Theoretical Framework for gender inclusion, a Toolkit of ready-to-use, hands-on activities for teenagers that address gender, national ‘Hub’ models, and input from young people, the Hypatia Project offers now insight and information on how the museum community can address gender inclusion in local and national communities. The lessons learned demonstrate how museums can act as tools to promote equitable STEM educational programming, preparing the next gender inclusive STEM-ready workforce. © 2020 International Council of Museums (ICOM).","Gender inclusion; Hubs; Science Centres; Science museums; STEM; Teens; Toolkit",,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020","The authors wish to thank all of the Hypatia Project’s partners for their support: Ecsite, the University of Copenhagen, the Museum of Science and Technology Leonardo da Vinci, Universcience, L’Oréal Foundation, PPG Industries, the Science Center Netzwerk, Noesis, Experyment, La Caixa, AHHA science centre, ASDC, Science Gallery Dublin, Teknikens Hus, and Bureauq.

Women, however, still make up a small part of computing communities, IT education and work - in the US and across Europe. The ""gender equality paradox"" is a label for women's underrepresentation in STEM disciplines, particularly in IT, that seems to be more extreme in highly gender egalitarian cultures. It has been suggested that the paradox is a result of women's choices in wealthy countries with a high degree of individual freedom. However, our research suggests that there is another side to this paradox, thus demonstrating the importance to recognize how other groups affect women's participation in IT. Our study of attitudes towards women's underrepresentation in IT among IT employers and organizations uncovers mixed signals from these actors, as they both welcome and doubt women in IT. Employers' negotiation of the meaning of women's underrepresentation in IT leaves little space for gender equality actions. While this can have major consequences for women's careers in computing and IT work, it also illustrates a central mechanism of the ""gender equality paradox"" characterized by a widely accepted norm of gender equality existing alongside employers' skepticism to the goal of gender balance in computing. © Proceedings of the 13th IADIS International Conference ICT, Society and Human Beings 2020, ICT 2020 and Proceedings of the 6th IADIS International Conference Connected Smart Cities 2020, CSC 2020 and Proceedings of the 17th IADIS International Conference Web Based Communities and Social Media 2020, WBC 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

Drawing on data from two research sites located in the UK, including observations of making and engineering activities with children aged 5–13 years, and interviews with nine key informants, we identify that play has three key affordances namely: (1) play can provide structure, (2) play is considered to be synonymous with open-ended science inquiry, and, (3) play can enable gender inclusive STEM spaces through promoting free-choice. We also note that overly simplistic framings of play may limit recognition by both adults and children of the educational value of these spaces and deny a fuller understanding of the opportunities that such spaces afford in providing children with moreopportunities to engage with STEM, particularly engineering. We suggest that play has an important pedagogical role in informal STEM activities, including making, when it is grounded in free-choice exploration and imagination. We argue for continued discussion and reflection upon both the value of play as a pedagogical vehicle and its affordances for enhancing youth engagement in STEM spaces. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","engineering; gender inclusive engagement; makerspaces; making; Play; STEM",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: NO 787476; European Commission, EC; Research Executive Agency, REA","This project has received funding from the European Union?s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement NO 787476.

This is especially the case in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Furthermore, women in STEM disciplines have been shown to file proportionately fewer invention disclosures and patents, launch fewer start-up companies and be less successful in attracting investment funding than their male counterparts. In this chapter the focus is on commercialisation at Birkbeck, University of London, drawing on data collected as part of the European Union-funded TRIGGER project. It is found that while commercialisation activity at Birkbeck is conducted by both men and women, principal investigators on externally awarded research grants are significantly more likely to be men. Seniority and networks also have an influence on ability to commercialise. In the organisational context there are issues with support for commercialisation activity. The study offers insights into women's attitudes and practices in commercialisation, which should be of value to universities and investors. © Helen Lawton Smith, Colette Henry, Henry Etzkowitz and Alexandra Poulovassilis 2020.

Studying behavioural dynamics is a valuable lens, both in public policy making and community planning and in scientific projects on how human behaviour affects ecosystems. Computational social science (CSS) offers a framework for this type of studies, as it connects a complex networked systems perspective with a suite of computational tools and methodologies. Despite its potential and fast growth, CSS is still hardly found in programmes at bachelor and master levels in Europe. We would like to take a closer look at this discrepancy. We discuss why there is a need to develop computational education in the social sciences and why it is a challenge. We consider two perspectives. In the students’ perspective, there is the problem of mathematical anxiety and gender inequalities in STEM education. In the academic teachers’ perspective, there is the problem of a split within social sciences, inadequacy of statistical models for analysing dynamics, and insufficient educational resources at an appropriate level of difficulty. We build a case for creating a MOOC programme addressed specifically to social sciences students to fill in the existing gaps, facilitate the organisation of learning communities, and advance computational thinking within social science. Creating such a MOOC programme is the goal of our Erasmus+ project “Action for Computational Thinking in Social Sciences” (ACTISS). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computational social science; Computational thinking; Educational innovation; Higher education; Massive open online course (MOOC)",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions Supporting Growth and Jobs – an Agenda for the Modernisation of Europe’s Higher Education Systems, , http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0567; Cioffi-Revilla, C., (2014) Introduction to Computational Social Science.

The method, based on performances, was tested in two case studies, Spain and the UK, on a sample of 2089 students. These performances have been shown to be an effective way of generating a two-way dialogue between students and researchers and prompting student reflections about researchers as role models, gender inequalities in science and ethical issues in STEM careers and scientific research. Furthermore, they have enhanced young people’s positive attitudes and interest in science, scientists and scientific careers and have debunked science-related stereotypes. This indicates that the performances evaluated in this study are supporting the aspirations of young people, but not limiting their inclination to critically assess the relative benefits and risks of scientific development for themselves. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Drama-based education; Responsible research and innovation; Science education; Scientific vocations; Student-centred pedagogy",,,,,,"665826","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European’s Union H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 665826: PERFORM “Participatory Engagement with Scientific and Technological Research through Performance”.",,,,,,"Aschbacher, P.R., Li, E., Roth, E.J., Is science me?

She was among several women from Imperial Russia to study medicine at Swiss universities in the late nineteenth century. Findings: Her observations on first trimester placenta built on those of her supervisor Theodor Langhans and a study of term placenta by her compatriot Raissa Nitabuch. She established the fetal origin of what is now known as the cytotrophoblastic shell. In addition, she made a close study of the uterine glands concluding that they did not connect to the intervillous space. Her subsequent career as an obstetrician was in a suburb of Buffalo, New York. Together with her husband and daughter she was a political activist. Discussion: Anna Reinstein-Mogilowa's life is discussed in the context of contemporary women in science including Raissa Nitabuch and Eva Chaletzy/Haljecka. Their stories are interpreted against the historical background of obstacles to the study and practise of medicine faced by nineteenth century women. © 2019","Cytotrophoblastic shell; History of science; Placentation; Uterine glands; Women in STEM","article; buffalo; career; cytotrophoblast; female; fetus; first trimester pregnancy; human; husband; intervillous space; male; New York; nonhuman; obstetrician; placenta development; Russian Federation; anatomy and histology; cytology; first trimester pregnancy; placenta; pregnancy; trophoblast; uterus; Female; Humans; Placenta; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Trophoblasts; Uterus",,,,,,,,,,,,"Anonymous, Eva Haljecka Petkovic (2019), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Haljecka_Petkovi%C4%87, (Accessed 8 October 2019); Beric, B.M., Dr Eva Haljecka (18..? - 1947) prva zena akuser-ginekolog u Jugoslovenskim Zemljama (1983) Jugoslav. ginek. opstet., 23, pp. 95-99; Burton, G.J., Maureen young, 1915-2013 (2013) Placenta, 34, pp. 1255-1256; Burton, G.J., Jauniaux, E., The cytotrophoblastic shell and complications of pregnancy (2017) Placenta, 60, pp. 134-139; Burton, G.J., Watson, A.L., Hempstock, J., Skepper, J.N., Jauniaux, E., Uterine glands provide histiotrophic nutrition for the human fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy (2002) J.

This under-representation becomes evident as the academic and professional scale progresses, making representation figures smaller at higher levels. This is due to the existence of stereotypes about the presence in the technological and scientific sector. Thus, horizontal segregation occurs. Intervention proposals for awareness-raising and recruitment are the result of empirical studies carried out using different methodologies and instruments, which have made it possible to survey reality. The present review of instruments arises within the framework of the doctoral thesis that studies the situation of the gender gap in the field of technological and scientific education, within the European framework. This thesis is developed from the mixed approach, giving rise to the sequencing between quantitative and qualitative techniques, for the subsequent triangulation. To this aim, it has been necessary to analyse which instruments are being used in the investigations with the greatest impact, in order to be able to follow their footsteps and propose the subsequent methodological design of the investigation. The paper presents the review process of instruments and the selected five instruments that, can be key pieces for the design mentioned above. © 2019 ACM.","Gender gap; Gender stereotypes; Leaky pipeline; Questionnaires; STEM; Surveys","Ecosystems; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Surveying; Surveys; Awareness raising; Empirical studies; Gender gap; Gender stereotypes; Questionnaires; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Scientific education; Scientific sectors; Engineering education",,,,,"FPU017/01252","This research work has been carried out within the University of Salamanca PhD Programme on Education in the Knowledge Society scope (http://knowledgesociety.usal.es) [10, 11], and this research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Inovación y Universidades under a FPU fellowship (FPU017/01252).",,,,,,"Berryman, S.E., (1983) Who Will Do Science?

It contributes to the line of research focusing on group work in MOOCs from a gender perspective when peer grading is carried out. In turn, it informs MOOC design. The results are based on a study of 6,000+ participants of a set of IT, business, and Design Thinking MOOCs to determine success in gender homogenous and heterogeneous virtual team tasks. The study uses observational data to track individual performance, based on gender, in online courses. Even though men were overrepresented, individual female performance in team assignments is shown to be significantly better than male performance. The results speak for successful teamwork in online courses on the one hand and open up further opportunities for good performance of women in STEM disciplines on the other hand. © 2019 IEEE.","Distance Learning; Gender; MOOC; Online Learning; Performance; STEM; Study; Virtual teamwork","Distance education; Grading; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Gender; MOOC; Online learning; Performance; Study; Virtual teamwork; E-learning",,,,,,,,,,,,"Staubitz, T., Meinel, C.H., Graded Team Assignments in MOOCs-Effects of Team Composition and Further Factors on Team Dropout Rates and Performance ACM Proceedings, , Chicago, June 2019 [6th Annual Conference on Learning at Scale]; Grossman, R., Are massive online courses in your future?

In a recent study, the authors of this paper noted that there has been and there is still an on-going discussion on the low percentage of females in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related studies. Some initiatives of engineers in the USA and Canada and current discussions in the IEEE community support the idea of adding an A (for Arts) in STEM leading to STEAM. With the element of gamification in many subjects and associated elements of Art in many disciplines, this strategy may help to improve the number of female students, as confirmed by a study performed in 2016. Topics with the hue of art are found in many STEM subjects and the staff responsible for courses can tune the content to accommodate these in already existing programs by putting more emphasis on 'Art'. This paper addresses possibilities of adding elements of 'Art' in existing courses with Biggs' Teaching and Learning, Intended Learning Outcomes and Assessment with gender balance in focus. The example of the Shad, Canada's successful STEAM and Entrepreneurship Live-in program for high-school (i.e. pre-university) students are cited. With respect to Biggs' model and using problem based learning (PBL), we point out, how the curricula in our universities in electrical engineering, IT and system engineering have many similarities with the pedagogical goals of the Shad program. This paper presents possibilities of incorporating elements of 'art' related topics in disciplines under focus in the EAEEIE-community. Experiences from some courses in our universities are also provided with some pertinent conclusions for STEAM studies with enhanced gender balance on national, regional and international levels. © 2019 IEEE.","Electrical Engineering and IT; Gender balance; Gender stereotypes; Mentoring; STEAM; STEM","Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Information analysis; Steam; Students; Teaching; Community support; Gender stereotypes; Intended learning outcomes; Mentoring; Pedagogical goals; Problem based learning; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Teaching and learning; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-countries-commit-boost-participation-women-digital; https://www.usaid.gov/egypt/gender-equality-And-womens-empowerment; http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-Areas/gender-And-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-And-gender-Advancement-saga; https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Banned-words-Berkeley-drops-he-she-14102930.php; https://eige.europa.eu; Perry, T.S., Want girls attracted to tech?

The underrepresentation of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) industry, together with the growing labour and skill shortage in the software industry, have both been major reasons why high-level decision makers have woken up to investigate the unbalanced gender division. The labour shortage is stated to be among the most significant reasons why software companies are not growing as fast as they wish. Therefore, new talents (and in this case, women) are expected by the industry. Universities are working hard to train new talents, governments are doing their share on the matter and now software companies have started to act on the cause all by themselves. However, the question is that what kind of role women software communities have in this labour and skill shortage picture?In this study, we examine the role of and need for the women software communities in attracting more women to the software industry. The empirical data is collected with an open internet survey (n=134) and the results highlight the importance of the women software communities as the low threshold inspiration actors and influencers to attract more women to the field. The results also emphasize the fact that women will benefit from peer support from other women, but when there is a need for more advanced trainings and events, gender limitation in participants is not needed. © 2019 IEEE.","career change; gender bias; gender in ICT; re-education; skills; Women in STEM","Decision making; Engineering research; Software engineering; career change; Gender bias; gender in ICT; Science , technology , engineering , mathematics; skills; Software community; Software company; Software industry; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Parker, G., Alstyne, M.V., Jiang, X., Platform ecosystems: How developers invert the firm (2017) MIS Quarterly, 41, pp. 255-266; (2017) The Digital Single Market-State of Play, , European Comission.

This decreases in higher education with 9% of females compared to 29% of males choosing a STEM subject in 2017 [1]. To address this issue there are many initiatives being set up to recruit females into STEM higher education courses. However there is a lack of research into the experiences of female students once they have started their degree programme in Computer Science. In this study we investigate the roles which undergraduate female students choose in a large software engineering team project to find out if there are barriers that prevent them from taking on technical or programming roles in these projects. We analysed assessment data to determine their previous programming experience and then performed a content analysis of team project deliverables and peer assessment scores. The results show that our female students, despite their strong academic background, tend to pick less technical roles in these projects than male students and are subsequently awarded lower peer review scores by their teammates for their contribution to the group work. These results indicate that teaching interventions may need to take place to make the role choice and peer review processes fairer in such projects. Further investigations are needed to see if there is some form of unconscious bias or imposter syndrome occurring in our software engineering team project module and if this is a common phenomenon in these projects in other HE institutions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Fair assessment; Gender; Peer review; Programming; Role choice; Software engineering; STEM; Team project","Engineering education; Mathematical programming; Software engineering; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Fair assessment; Gender; Peer review; Role choice; Team projects; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Resources | The Stem Education Pipeline 2017, , https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/statistics/the-stem-education-pipeline-2017/, November Accessed on 11/10/2018; (2013) National Curriculum in England: Computing Programmes of Study - Gov.Uk, , https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study, September Accessed on 11/10/2018; (2017) After the Reboot: Computing Education in Schools, , https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/computing-education/computing-education-report.pdf, November Accessed on 11/10/2018; We’re Showing the next Generation that Girls do Science, Technology, Engineering & Maths (Stem) Too at Our Free, Fun, Food-Filled Experiences. - Stemettes, , http://stemettes.org/, Accessed on 11/10/2018; (2016) People like Me, , https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/people-like-me, Accessed on 11/10/2018; Computing at School, , https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/custom_pages/270-cas-include, CAS Include.

The missing women in IT have long been a topic of concern and several factors are known to contribute to this gender gap. Among the factors identified in the literature, there is a misconception of the role of IT and its role in everyday life. In turn, this might result in a decrease in interest. The aim of this research is to explore the possibility to increase girls´ awareness about IT in an accessible and engaging way. With this objective, the paper presents the design of CITY, a game concept aiming at explaining the role that technology plays in everyday life.

Suddenly, it is possible to measure human behavior, performance, and activity on an unprecedented scale, opening the door to fundamental advances in discovery and understanding. Yet such access to data has limitations that, if not sufficiently addressed and explored, can result in significant oversights. Here we discuss recent research that used data from a large global sample of high school students to demonstrate, paradoxically, that in nations with higher gender equality, fewer women pursued science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees than would be expected based on aptitude in those subjects. The reasons for observed patterns is central to current debates, with frequent disagreement about the nature and magnitude of problems posed by the lack of female representation in STEM and the best ways to deal with them. In our international efforts to use big data in education research, it is necessary to critically consider its limitations and biases. © 2019 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stoet, G., Geary, D.C., The gender-equality paradox in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education (2018) Psychol Sci, , 0956797617741719; (2016) The Global Gender Gap Report, , World Economic Forum.

The context of the time after the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War is shown, as well as the social and political changes that are significant for education and were prompted by the wars. The emergence of the international Organization for Economic Coopera­tion and Development (OECD) (whose focus is not educational but eco­nomic) and the role of behavioural psychology were also analysed, which explained their significance in later educational reforms. The role of the Cold War in reducing socio-humanistic teaching contents and the imple­mentation of natural sciences and mathematics has also been explained. The synthesis of the analysed aspects suggests that the Cold War mili­tary and technological race resulted in the implementation of the STEM area, thus the measurability of learning outcomes, which influenced the psychologisation, standardisation, economisation, and globalisation of education. Most of the current (un)successful national educational and curricular reforms were initiated in that direction without respect for the social, cultural, and historical features of individual countries. These changes have left a mark in pedagogy, in which the humanistic approach appears to counteract other approaches. Some educational systems dem­onstrate a shift from such trends, from the technical-scientific curriculum towards the didactic tradition of Bildung and the philosophy of education. The reasons can be found in the above-average results on international standardised evaluations of those countries that have national curricula, in contrast to what is recommended by the globalisation and standardisation of education as some of the elements of the Cold War heritage. © 2019, University of Ljubljana.

From analysis of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we first show that married or cohabiting women do twice as much household work as single women with the same income. Furthermore, women’s time spent in home production does not vary in relation to the couple’s relative wages in Southern Europe. We find a positive elasticity of substitution between male and female labor in home production with respect to their relative within-couple wages in Western Europe. Our identification is based on predicting each country’s wage distributions within gender-specific cells defined by age group and education using distributions in all the other countries. We present a positive evidence for presence of a “second-shift” that women face especially in Southern Europe, which may stem from regional gender norms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Division of labor; Elasticity of substitution; Gender gap; Household production",,,,,,"Univerzita Karlova v Praze, UK; Grantová Agentura České Republiky, GA ČR: 17-09119Y, 20-12023S","We offer our sincere thanks to David Card, Matias Cortes, Christian Dustmann, Hilary Hoynes, Andrea Ichino, St?p?n Jurajda, Kl?ra Kal??kov?, Shelly Lundberg, Vincenzo Merella, Nikolas Mittag, Barbara Pertold-G?bicka, and conference participants at the 2019 SOLE annual meeting for insightful comments and fruitful discussions.

Specifically, females are underrepresented in STEM industries. Identifying how male and female students deal with STEM learning challenges, and how this relates to learning outcomes, may inform teaching that best supports the preferences of individual students. This study asked secondary school students, who had just completed a STEM lesson that they reported as finding difficult (n = 3758; male = 51.2%), to write narratives about how they dealt with the lesson. Narratives were analyzed using a linguistic text analysis program to identify core psychological processes contained within the narratives from lessons in science n = 1305 (males = 46.3%), technology n = 589 (males = 63.7%), engineering n = 202 (males = 57.9%), and mathematics n = 1662 (males = 49.9%). Students were also asked to score how well they think they did in the difficult lesson (learning outcome). Pearson's correlations between students' use of core psychological processes and their perceptions of lesson success were computed separately for males and females. Common strategies emerged across the STEM subjects: for female students, positive learning outcomes were associated with positive emotions, social processes, rewards, and strategic thinking. For male students, positive learning outcomes were associated with motivation around the risk of failing, rationalizing the problem, and strategic thinking. Negative emotion was associated with a negative learning outcome for both broadly defined genders, but this was more evident across the subjects for females. We specify our understanding of this strategy by reporting data separately for the STEM subjects and the implications for STEM pedagogy. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","gender gap; learning strategies; psychological processes; STEM",,,,,,"Leverhulme Trust: RPG‐2018‐368","The funding for this study was supported by the Leverhulme Trust, Research Project Grant (Award ID: RPG‐2018‐368).",,,,,,"Alvarez-Vargas, D., Abad, C., Pruden, S.M., Spatial anxiety mediates the sex difference in adult mental rotation test performance (2020) Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 5 (1), pp. 1-17; Archer, L., Dawson, E., DeWitt, J., Seakins, A., Wong, B., ""Science capital"": A conceptual, methodological, and empirical argument for extending Bourdieusian notions of capital beyond the arts (2015) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 52 (7), pp. 922-948; Ball, C., Huang, K.-T., Cotten, S.R., Rikard, R., Pressurizing the STEM pipeline: An expectancy-value theory analysis of youths' STEM attitudes (2017) Journal of Science Education and Technology, 26 (4), pp. 372-382; Baron-Cohen, S., (2003) The essential difference: The truth about the male and female brain, , Basic Books; Benbow, C.P., Lubinski, D., Shea, D.L., Eftekhari-Sanjani, H., Sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability at age 13: Their status 20 years later (2000) Psychological Science, 11 (6), pp. 474-480; Botella, C., Rueda, S., López-Iñesta, E., Marzal, P., Gender diversity in STEM disciplines: A multiple factor problem (2019) Entropy, 21 (1), p. 30; Chiang, W.W., Liu, C.J., Scale of academic emotion in science education: Development and validation (2014) International Journal of Science Education, 36 (6), pp. 908-928; Christodoulou, A., Engaging in and with research to improve STEM education (2017) Research Papers in Education, 32 (4), pp. 535-537; Codiroli Mcmaster, N., Who studies STEM subjects at A level and degree in England?

For this purpose, a systematic review and subsequent applied analysis of the UAE context was developed. The systematic review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. The review was performed on EBSCO, ProQuest, Wiley Online Library, Gale, Taylor and Francis Online, SAGE Complete, and JSTOR. The initial database search yielded 168 articles. Following a review of the corresponding abstracts, eight full-text articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected. The results obtained are discussed in the context of the UAE and help inform policy proposals and future research lines to strengthen the involvement of women in STEM careers. The study found that while women in the UAE have greater access to education in engineering and STEM fields, women’s employment prospects in these sectors remain fraught. © 2021 by the authors.

However, these fields differ vastly in female representation: women tend to be most strongly underrepresented in technological and computer science university majors and to a lesser extent in mathematics and chemistry, while they are less underrepresented in biological sciences. To understand this variability, we examine how girls in the process of making higher education choices compare different STEM-fields to each other. We draw upon dimensional comparison theory, which argues that educational motivation involves intra-individual comparisons of achievement across school subjects. However, previous research has shown that a focus on achievement in STEM is not enough, anticipated belonging in a STEM-field plays a pivotal role in interest in pursuing that field. Consistent with this, we examined participants’ comparisons of anticipated belonging across STEM-fields. A sample of 343 high school girls in STEM-focused university tracks completed a survey on their anticipated belonging and interest in pursuing different STEM majors. Latent Profile Analysis resulted in 3 profiles, showing different belonging comparison patterns across STEM-fields. Examining these comparisons—both within and across profiles—showed how girls felt pushed away from certain STEM-fields and pulled toward others. The findings suggest that for interest in pursuing specific STEM-fields it is not just about the level of anticipated belonging within that STEM-field, but just as much about the level of anticipated belonging in comparison to another STEM-field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Belonging; Career interests; Dimensional comparisons; Gender; Girls in STEM; Women in STEM",,,,,,,"This work was supported by an Odysseus grant to Colette Van Laar (Grant Number G.O.E66.14 N) and a fellowship grant to Jenny Veldman (Grant Number 11A2418N), both from the Research Foundation of Flanders.",,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F., Leary, M.R., The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation (1995) Psychological Bulletin, 117, pp. 497-529; Belanger, A.L., Joshi, M.P., Fuesting, M.A., Weisgram, E.S., Claypool, H.M., Diekman, A.B., Putting belonging in context: Communal affordances signal belonging in STEM (2020) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 8, pp. 1186-1204; Bian, L., Leslie, S.J., Cimpian, A., Gender stereotypes about intellectual ability emerge early and influence children’s interests (2017) Science, 355, pp. 389-391; Breda, T., Napp, C., Girls’ comparative advantage in reading can largely explain the gender gap in math-related fields (2019) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; Casad, B.J., Petzel, Z.W., Ingalls, E.A., A model of threatening academic environments predicts women STEM majors’ self-esteem and engagement in STEM (2019) Sex Roles, 80, pp. 469-488; Ceci, S.J., Ginther, D.K., Kahn, S., Williams, W.M., Women in academic science: A changing landscape (2014) Psychological Science in the Public Interest, 15, pp. 75-141; Ceci, S.J., Williams, W.M., Barnett, S.M., Women's underrepresentation in science: Sociocultural and biological considerations (2009) Psychological Bulletin, 135, pp. 218-261; Cejka, M.A., Eagly, A.H., Gender-stereotypic images of occupations correspond to the sex segregation of employment (1999) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, pp. 413-423; Cheryan, S., Plaut, V.C., Davies, P.G., Steele, C.M., Ambient belonging: How stereotypical cues impact gender participation in computer science (2009) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, pp. 1045-1060; Cheryan, S., Ziegler, S.A., Montoya, A.K., Jiang, L., Why are some STEM fields more gender balanced than others?

The present study addresses both issues by exploring how the fit between a student's vocational interests and the STEM field contributes to a (non-) STEM study choice. Data was collected in the unique setting of an open access and low cost higher education system, which allowed for study of vocational interests without unwanted influence of admission conditions. Specifically, we assessed the interest fit of N = 9162 first-year Belgian university students with (1) the STEM field (i.e., STEM fit) and (2) their specific program of choice (i.e., program fit). Results indicated STEM fit indeed predicted STEM study choice, with a stronger effect in female students. Results also indicated that female students showed a better specific program fit. In order to promote student STEM enrolment and address the gender gap, the present study therefore advocates a gender-specific approach to attract more students with appropriate interest profiles. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","PE interest fit; Person-environment interest fit; STEM; STEM fit; STEM gender gap; STEM profile; STEM study choice",,,,,,"Universiteit Gent","We have acknowledged that the current research was funded by Ghent University through the SIMON project.",,,,,,"Abbiss, J., Gendering the ICT curriculum: The paradox of choice (2009) Computers and Education, 53 (2), pp. 343-354; Ainley, J., Kos, J., Nicholas, M., Participation in science, mathematics and technology in Australian education (2008), https://research.acer.edu.au/acer_monographs/4, Australian Council for Educational Research; Allen, J., Robbins, S., Effects of interest–major congruence, motivation, and academic performance on timely degree attainment (2010) Journal of Counseling Psychology, 57 (1), pp. 23-35; Bagiati, A., Yoon, S.Y., Evangelou, D., Ngambe-ki, I., Engineering curricula in early education: Describing the landscape of open resources (2010) Early Childhood Research & Practice, 12 (2). , https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ910909; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective (2001) Annual Review of Psychology, 52, pp. 1-26; Blackburn, H., The status of women in STEM in higher education: A review of the literature 2007–2017 (2017) Science and Technology Libraries, 36 (3); Browne, M.W., Circumplex models for correlation matrices (1992) Psychometrika, 57 (47), pp. 469-497. , (10.1007bf02294416); Buchmann, C., DiPrete, T.A., McDaniel, A., Gender inequalities in education (2008) Annual Review of Sociology, 34, pp. 319-337; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., Model selection and multimodel inference: A practical information-theoretic approach (2002), 2nd ed.

This is a research area essential to broadening the participation across the genders in the much-needed STEM workforce, whose size is currently held back by a significant gender disparity. In the review, 13 (quasi-)experimental studies were selected for synthesis, from a total of 1093 results found across multiple search queries applied to six scientific databases. When synthesizing the results and findings from the included studies, four major categories of research interest were identified. On the basis hereof, a list of recommendations, which are readily implementable in most curriculums for both compulsory education and extracurricular activities, was established. The recommendations revolve around: The choice of technology, applied contextualization, approaches to teaching, and gender compositions. In addition, we discuss the current extent of research on the topic, which shows indications of becoming more active in recent years, while likewise discussing the reviews implications for future research directions. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Agricultural robots; Robotics; Social robots; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Contextualization; Educational robotics; Extracurricular activities; Gender disparity; Implications for futures; Research interests; Scientific database; Systematic Review; Educational robots",,,,,,,,,,,,"Schoolnet, E., (2018) European Schoolnet's 2017 Annual Report, , eun.org-Brussels, Belgium; Future, E.T., (2018) Prognose for STEM-mangel 2025, , Engineer the Future: engineerthefuture. dk; Wing, J.M., Computational thinking (2006) Communications of the ACM, 49 (3), pp. 33-35; Schoolnet, E., (2017) The Integration of Computational Thinking (CT) across School Curricula in Europe., , European Schoolnet: eun. org; Michel, R.P., Csermely, D., Jorde, D., Lenzen, H., Walberg-Henriksson, V.H., (2007) Science Education NOW: A Renewed Pedagogy for the Future of Europe., , ec.europa.eu, European Commission; Atmatzidou, S., Demetriadis, S., Advancing students' computational thinking skills through educational robotics: A study on age and gender relevant differences (2016) Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 75, pp. 661-670; Sáez-López, J.-M., Sevillano-García, M.-L., Vazquez-Cano, E., The effect of programming on primary school students' mathematical and scientific understanding: Educational use of mbot (2019) Educational Technology Research and Development, 67 (6), pp. 1405-1425; Blanchard, S., Freiman, V., Lirrete-Pitre, N., Strategies used by elementary schoolchildren solving robotics-based complex tasks: Innovative potential of technology (2010) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 2 (2), pp. 2851-2857; Bers, M.U., Computational thinking and tinkering: Exploration of an early childhood robotics curriculum (2014) Computers & Education, 72, pp. 145-157; Caballero-Gonzalez, Y.-A., Muñoz-Repiso, A.G.-V., García-Holgado, A., Learning computational thinking and social skills development in young children through problem solving with educational robotics (2019) Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality.; Roussou, E., Rangoussi, M., On the use of robotics for the development of computational thinking in kindergarten: Educational intervention and evaluation (2019) International Conference on Robotics and Education RiE 2017, , Springer; Dourish, P., (2004) Where the Action Is: The Foundations of Embodied Interaction., , MIT press; Merkouris, A., Chorianopoulos, K., Introducing computer programming to children through robotic and wearable devices (2015) Proceedings of the Workshop in Primary and Secondary Computing Education.; Papert, S.A., (2020) Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas, , Basic books; (2017) BBC Micro: Bit Celebrates Huge Impact in First Year, with 90% of Students Saying It Helped Show That Anyone Can Code, , https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/microbit-firstyear, [cited 2020 14th of December]; (2021) Foundation, M.

At that time, women’s success rates had improved from one in five in 2002 to one in four in 2012 and the percentages of female proposal reviewers were roughly the same as the percentages of female faculty. In the same special edition of Oceanography O’Connell [] called for greater attention to be given to women and minorities in NSF awards in the Division. In 2015 the COV for OCE cited O’Connell and wrote at length on the low percentages of awards to women principal investigators, with men receiving 2.5–3 times as many awards, which they attributed to the low numbers of women faculty in ocean science. NSF was commended for two programs, Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention (MPOWIR) and ADVANCE, which aim to increase parity in physical oceanography and S&E respectively, and encouraged to continue such mentoring programs. Despite these two Reviews of OCE, in 2019 the COV Review provided this recommendation: “III.1.6: The program should prioritize any institutional effort to enhance diversity because women and people of color continue to remain significantly underrepresented in the ocean sciences.” To which the NSF responded, “We agree and acknowledge that the lack of diversity is a persistent issue for OCE. We will report back on our plans to address this.” It should be noted that MPOWIR is also supported by the US Office of Naval Research, Department of Energy, NOAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in addition to the NSF.",,,,,,"Isensee, K., (2020) Global Ocean Science Report 2020-Charting Capacity for Ocean Sustainability, , IOC-UNESCO UNESCO Publishing Paris; Huyer, S., (2015) UNESCO Science Report: Towards 2030, , UNESCO Publishing Paris; (2020), https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/195aeab2319944d8b2dfa7ff069c2f3a, Rachel Carson as quoted in: In their own words: Women doing NOAA's work.

Gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls is the fifth goal set by the United Nations in 2015 (out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals in total) that is intended to be achieved by the year 2030. It is in fact fully understood that we cannot simply afford missing out on half (actually more) of the human capital and potential and one of the key factors to achieve this is education for all. Together with broader themes like diversity and inclusion, gender equality has also made it to the top of many institutions/organizations agendas, because diverse teams are more creative, more productive and improve the working experience and environment for everybody. To this end, a significant push has also come from regular reports published by international or consultancy agencies like the World Economic Forum (WEF) or Mc Kinsey that have often made the news headlines with highly visible and provocative titles. The most recent WEF Global Gender Gap Report 2020 clearly states that ""It will take us another 99.5 years to reach gender parity""and that ""It will be the year 2277 when the gender pay gap will close"". In this review, the focus will be on a specific STEM field that has always fascinated generations of people, just by looking up at the peaceful beauty of a night sky: astronomy. © 2021 IUPAC & De Gruyter.

In this line, entrepreneurial intention has been pointed out as an indicator of latent entrepreneurship. In this article, the entrepreneurial intention of university students is studied from a configurational approach, allowing the study of the combined effect of corruption perception, corruption normalization, gender, university career area, and family entrepreneurial background to explain high levels of entrepreneurial intention. The model was tested with the fsQCA methodology according to two samples of students grouped according to their household income (medium and high level: N = 180; low level: N = 200). Stress tests were run to confirm the robustness of the results. This study highlights the negative impact produced by corruption among university students’ entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, the importance of family entrepreneurial background for specific archetypes like female, STEM, and low household income students is pointed out, as well as the importance of implementing education programs for entrepreneurship in higher education, and more specifically in STEM areas. Policies focused on facilitating the access to financial resources for female students and low household income students, and specific programs to foster female entrepreneurship, are also recommended. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, we analyse whether discrimination against women is moderated by the occupation’s sex composition, required level of decision-making and expected educational level. To do so, we carried out a correspondence study in 2016, in which we sent two pairs of matched male–female applications to 1371 job postings for a heterogeneous selection of occupations in two large cities in Spain. Differences in response rates and response order by gender were then used as a tool to assess discrimination. The results show that job characteristics matter for gender discrimination and that their effects are complementary. Women were particularly discriminated against in connection with jobs that involved decision-making, in male-dominated and mixed occupations, and in jobs requiring both high and low education levels. This discrimination is likely to stem from the activation of both stereotypes and prejudices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Correspondence testing; Field experiments; Gender discrimination; Gender stereotypes; Hiring","decision making; education; experiment; gender discrimination; job search; multivariate analysis; occupation; womens status; Spain",,,,,"“la Caixa” Foundation: Recercaixa2014","Funding was provide by “la Caixa” Foundation (Grant no.

While different studies have been conducted about potential reasons explaining this gap, little is known about gender inequality and underlying factors in the Earth Observation and Geoinformatics (EO∗GI) domain. To close some parts of this knowledge gap, the initiative Women in Copernicus was established with the overall goal to make women working in the EO∗GI field and especially in the Copernicus ecosystem more visible. This paper analyses the results of a survey of 462 women identifying reasons for not choosing STEM education and the barriers related to educational choices in their career path. The main obstacles that hinder choosing a STEM education for these women are stereotypes in society, missing female role models but also culture, television and society message transmitted by the media. The lack of self-confidence is an essential factor in this choice and is also experienced as a barrier during individual career paths. This analysis provides insights valuable for political decisions making targeting at a gender-balanced work environment and emphasizes the importance of attracting more girls and young women towards a STEM education and supporting them during their career to reach skills and occupational equality and strengthen the economic development of the EO∗GI sector. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In the case of higher education, one of the most powerful sites of intervention is the classroom. The last decade has seen a proliferation of research exploring new teaching techniques and course sequencing and their effect on the retention of students who have historically been excluded from computing. This research suggests interventions and practices that can affect the inclusiveness of the computer science classroom and potentially improve learning outcomes for all students. But research needs to be translated into practice, and practices need to be taken up in real classrooms. The goal of this working group (WG) is to conduct a systemic ""state-of-the-art""review of recent empirical studies of teaching practices that have some explicit test of the impact on women (or other under-represented groups) in computing. The WG will produce an annotated bibliography and a report that distills the research into specific, actionable practices. © 2021 Owner/Author.","curriculum addressing gender and diversity; gender and diversity; inclusive culture; learning environment; teaching practices; undergraduate instruction","Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Broadening participation; Empirical studies; Higher education; Learning outcome; Science classroom; State of the art; Teaching practices; Under-represented groups; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aspray, W., Participation in computing (2010) The National Science Foundation's Expansionary Programs, , Springer International Publishing, Switzerland (2010); Barr, V., Diferent denominators, diferent results: Reanalyzing cs degrees by gender, race, and ethnicity (2018) Acm Inroads, 9 (3), pp. 40-47. , 2018; Bobb, K., Broadening participation in computing: A critical perspective (2016) Acm Inroads, 7 (4), pp. 49-51. , 2016; Camp, T., DuBow, W., Levitt, D., Sax, L.J., Taylor, V., Lewis, C., The new nsf requirement for broadening participation in computing (bpc) plans: Community advice and resources (2019) Proceedings of the 50th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education., pp. 332-333; Cuny, J., Changing what's happening in hs and introductory college cs: Keynote address (2010) Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 26 (2), pp. 5-6. , 2010; DuBow, W., Gonzalez, J.J., (2020) Ncwit Scorecard: The Status of Women in Technology, , Boulder, CO: NCWIT; DuBow, W.M., Quinn, B.A., Townsend, G.C., Robinson, R., Barr, V., Eforts to make computer science more inclusive of women (2016) Acm Inroads, 7 (4), pp. 74-80. , 2016; (2020) Women in Digital, , https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/women-digital-0, European Commission; Grant, M.J., Booth, A., A typology of reviews: An analysis of 14 review types and associated methodologies (2009) Health Information & Libraries Journal, 26 (2), pp. 91-108. , 2009; (2019) Higher Education Student Statistics: UK, 2017/18-Student Numbers and Characteristics, , https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/17-01-2019/sb252-higher-education-student-statistics/numbers, Higher Education Statistics Agency; Margolis, J., Fisher, A., (2002) Unlocking the Clubhouse: Women in Computing, , MIT press; Monge, A.E., Fadjo, C.L., Quinn, B.A., Barker, L.J., Engagecsedu: Engaging and retaining cs1 and cs2 students (2015) Acm Inroads, 6 (1), pp. 6-11. , 2015; (2020) Engagement Practices Framework, , https://www.ncwit.org/engagement-practices-framework, National Center for Women & Information Technology; Ramsey, N., McCorduck, P., Where are the women in information technology (2005) Report of Literature Search and InterviewsPrepared for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, , 2005; (2021) Percentages of Women in Stem Statistics, , https://www.stemwomen.co.uk/blog/2021/01/women-in-stem-percentages-of-women-in-stem-statistics, STEM Women",,,"ACM SIGCSE","Association for Computing Machinery","26th ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, ITiCSE 2021","26 June 2021 through 1 July 2021",,169623,1942647X,9781450383974,,,"English","Annu.

Some have implemented curriculum reforms to this end, others may do so. Using experiences from curriculum reforms in Germany, the Netherlands and, in particular, Sweden, we consider a proposal from the Royal Society in England about a broader curriculum for 16–19-year-olds, involving more mathematics and science. In Sweden, a curriculum reform in 1995, for 16–20-year-olds, increased the academic content of vocational programmes, including mathematics and science, such that they provided eligibility to university studies. Another reform, in 2011, reinstated the distinctions between vocational and academic programmes and made courses yielding university eligibility compulsory for academic programmes only. Using longitudinal student population data for 1986–2017, we assess the reform outcomes through before-after comparisons. The 1995 reform was followed by decreased recruitment to STEM studies while the opposite was true for the 2011 reform. A reform in Germany requiring students to study more mathematics was not very successful, either. We connect the positive consequences following the 2011 reform to the extensive Swedish opportunities to change study path. Including the option to attend a 1-year ‘add-on’ education programme, enabling students with non-STEM upper secondary background to conduct STEM university studies, changes to STEM programmes dominate changes away from them. Accordingly, we recommend more, not less, flexibility in programme choice, preferably coupled with efforts to improve female STEM attitudes, which have proved effective in Sweden. © 2021 The Authors.

This can be due to the fact that the origin of domestic violence is different from the origin of other types of violence. It is paramount that domestic violence is understood both as a cultural problem and a cultural practice, and it is necessary to discuss the concepts of abuse and social normalization by means of a set of discourses and beliefs on the subject. Domestic violence stems from power relations established in gender inequality, from the polarization of the concept and the use of this perception for the organization of socio-cultural activities. One of the ways to combat a problem which is firmly grounded on cultural practices is through education and social discussion based on reflection and deconstruction of social discourses. Advertising is commonly seen as a cultural practice or discourse capable of changing needs. Some would even hold it, at least in part, responsible for consumption problems and for making a profit out of sexist values. Similarly, advertising may also be able to promote other types of knowledge and function as an agent of social change, through institutional advertising. This chapter proposes a theoretical reflection on the phenomenon of domestic violence based on its understanding as a problem sustained by cultural beliefs and discourses and which can be tackled through education and the promotion of public debate, by means of institutional advertisements. We have also analysed the way Portuguese advertising campaigns against domestic violence encourage further debate on this issue. It is our intention to foster discussion on the fight against domestic violence based on the analysis of beliefs and discourses about the phenomenon and on the ways institutional advertising campaigns can contribute to the promotion of a social debate on the subject, based on their ability to effectively reach different target audiences, namely the victims, the aggressors and the population in general. The research which underlies the theoretical approach of this project, in broad lines, analyzes institutional advertising campaigns that fight domestic violence, taking into account their target audiences, the messages conveyed and the different persuasive strategies used. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Advertising; Domestic violence; Institutional advertising campaigns",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Altstiel, A., Grow, J., Jennings, M., (2020) Advertising creative: Strategy, copy, design, , 5th ed.

When most institutions of higher education have already strengthened and consolidated their curricula, the next challenge is to include and ensure that all people have the same opportunities to progress in education. This study intends to incorporate the gender dimension in teaching through a guide providing recommendations for the introduction of changes that will allow its effective incorporation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) areas. It will take into account the administration in charge of formulating policies in the field of education, the students, and, mainly, the teaching staff. Its objective is to cover aspects related to the principles of equal opportunities and gender equality in STEM higher education disciplines. For this purpose, 41 volunteer teachers from 8 degrees and master’s degrees from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Spain participated. To achieve the results of this study, aspects related to social and gender relevance of the subjects, inclusive methodology, classroom management and assessment were considered. As a preliminary step to the development of the guide of recommendations, a teacher’s self-assessment tool and a questionnaire for students to analyze the perception of the gender dimension were developed. © 2021 by the authors.

Since it is still mainly women who provide childcare, a discussion about re-traditionalization has emerged in the context of the Corona crisis. Up to now, there are hardly any empirical findings on gender effects of the Corona pandemic on participation in further education. We make a contribution to this political, societal as well as economical relevant topic by analyzing participation, learning efforts, and completion rates in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) during the Corona pandemic with a focus on gender aspects. Based on micro theoretical approaches as well as hypotheses of social and economic influences on participation in continuing education, we quantitatively examine the access as well as participants' engagement and success to more than ten MOOCs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) offered during the Corona-related restrictions in 2020 and one year before by gender. Based on descriptive statistics, we register increasing course enrollments, but a decreasing share of female learners since the Corona-related restrictions. Nevertheless, we Figure out that both participating men as well as women access more digital learning materials and reach higher completion rates than before the Corona crisis. Our multivariate linear probability models indicate further influences of socio-economic variables, such as career status. With regard to the current state of research, we discuss our findings, draw conclusions, formulate implications, and give an outlook on our future research. © 2021 IEEE.","Corona; Gender; Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)","E-learning; Engineering education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Continuing education; Descriptive statistics; Digital learning materials; Empirical findings; Linear probability models; Massive open online course; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; Theoretical approach; Economic and social effects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Jessen, J., Waights, S., Spieß, C.K., Geschlossene kitas: Mütter tragen mit blick auf zeiteinteilung vermutlich die hauptlast (2020) DIW Aktuell, 34. , April; Blatter, M., Hartwagner, F., Digitale lehr-und lernbegleiter. mit lernplattformen und web-2. 0-tools wirkungsvoll lehr-und lernprozesse gestalten (2015), Bonn: hep verlag; (2019) Weiterbildungsverhalten in Deutschland 2018.

The confinement due to the Covid19 pandemic has only made this reality even more visible. Some studies indicate that by increasing empowering women and girls in settings where they are a minority, economic and social benefits are also obtained. The W-STEM project aims to increase women's participation in STEM disciplines. The paper presents preliminary results of a diagnosis of different STEM programs at one university in Colombia. Results show that seven STEM programs have low female enrolment. Therefore, the paper presents various activities developed to motivate young women to enroll in STEM programs. The activities were open to all interested students, showing that 47% of women participated in the activities. Thus, these processes empower women by providing information and inclusion in spaces to acquire new knowledge and skills. © 2021 IEEE.","Gender Gap; Role Models; Women in STEM","Engineering education; Program diagnostics; Colombia; Different stages; Economic and social benefits; STEM program; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"European Commission, EC: EAC / A05 / 2017","The low participation of women in STEM disciplines is not a reality exclusive to developing countries.

Policymakers suggest that, in order to target effectively under-represented groups, such as women, entrepreneurship education and related experiences should be examined in particular so specific policies and programs can be created. Nevertheless, there is limited knowledge of women engaged in entrepreneurship in the case of the STEM field, and few studies explore the effects of entrepreneurial learning experiences on entrepreneurial attitudes and behavior. By analyzing a sample of engineering students, this study confirms the gender gap in entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions. Besides, it confirms the importance of entrepreneurial learning experiences (in this case junior enterprises) not only for the development of engineering students' entrepreneurial attitudes and intention but also to close the gap between men and women regarding social norms and perceived behavior control. This study provides several implications for both researchers and higher education, by contributing to a very limited and fragment literature on the topic of women entrepreneurs in STEM, by suggesting several further research avenues and by providing several recommendations to promote learning by doing approaches in higher education. © 2021 IEEE.","Engineering education; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurship education; Female entrepreneurship; Junior enterprise; Women in engineering","Engineering education; Professional aspects; Students; Entrepreneurial attitude; Entrepreneurship education; Higher education; Learning by doing; Learning experiences; Under-represented groups; Women entrepreneurs; Women in engineering; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"Universidade de Aveiro, UA","This work was supported by the University of Aveiro, with a PhD grant awarded to Joao Almeida","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the University of Aveiro, with a PhD grant awarded to João Almeida.",,,,,"(2004) Women's Entrepreneurship: Issues and Policies; Ahl, H., Why research on women entrepreneurs needs new directions (2006) Entrep.

It is a goal of large international organisations, governments, companies and other entities. Although it is not a new issue, it is important to continue studying it and seek mechanisms and strategies to attract and maintain more women in these areas. In particular, in the field of education and employment, the STEM areas present large gender gaps whose reduction would not only impact the equality of men and women but would also have an impact on the economy of the countries and on improving the economic situation of women. In this context, there are initiatives in Latin America working on this issue, but it is necessary to look more deeply into the elements that influence the decision to study careers in these areas. In this context, two focus groups have been held as roundtables with STEM women from different Latin American and European countries, to answer a series of questions centred on their motivations and decisions before and during their university studies. The results obtained have provided some inputs for defining gender equality action plans in ten Higher Education Institutions from Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Mexico. Furthermore, the results show similarities with previous studies involving STEM women with different Latin American profiles. © 2021 IEEE.","Engineer; Gender gap; Mathematician; Qualitative analysis; STEM; Women students","Engineering education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Economic situation; Engineering and mathematics; European Countries; Focus group studies; Gender equality; Higher education institutions; Latin America; Latin americans; Professional aspects",,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: FPU017/01252, FPU17/03276; European Commission, EC: 598923-EPP-1-2018- 1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP","This research was partially supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Inovacion y Universidades under a FPU fellowship (FPU017/01252 and FPU17/03276).","This work has been possible with the support of the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union in its Key Action 2 ""Capacity-building in Higher Education"".

Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students underrepresented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms. © 2021 IEEE.","Computational Pedagogy; Computational Thinking; Physical Computing; STEM; Women in Engineering","Education computing; Educational robots; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Computational thinkings; Computing education; Education robotics; Engineering design; Engineering schools; Physical computing; Science , technology , engineering , mathematics; Teaching and learning; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Brennan, K., Resnick, M., New frameworks for studying and assessing the development of computational thinking (2012) American Education Researcher Association, , Vancouver, Canada 2012; Kafai, Y.B., Burke, Q., Computer programming goes back to school (2013) Phi Delta Kappan, 95 (1), pp. 61-65. , 2013; Lye, S.Y., Koh, J.H.L., Review on teaching and learning of computational thinking through programming: What is next for k-12?

This is why we developed an online counselling tool that supports female students and graduates of STEM programs in their entry into professional life. The online tool bases on the results of scientific studies, such as interviews with female experts, online survey, and CV analysis, determining success factors of women's careers in STEM sectors. The findings are digitally bundled, vividly presented, and are demonstrated in a format that matches the input from previous career stages. Thus, the online tool automatically offers suitable tips for career planning and motivation for career continuation. This article presents the development process of the online tool from research to practical implementation. The challenges of an online tool for career planning as well as its potential for career counselling of female students and graduates are critically examined. © 2021 IEEE.","Female leadership; Online tool; STEM sector; Women career counselling","Engineering education; Engineering research; Students; Career planning; Development process; Female students; Online surveys; Professional life; Scientific studies; Success factors; Women's careers; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Valian, V., Women at the top in science-and elsewhere (2007) Why Aren't More Women in Science?

In the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, that need is even more urgent since technological sectors are men-dominated. Despite the significant progress made towards gender inequality in the last decades, we are far from the ideal scenario. Changes towards equality are too slow and uneven across different world regions. Monitoring gender parity is essential to understand priorities and specificities in each world region. However, it is challenging because of the scarcity and the cost to obtain data, especially in less developed countries. In this paper we study how the Facebook Advertising Platform (Facebook Ads) can be used to assess gender imbalance in education, focusing on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) areas, which are the main focus of the Fourth Revolution. As a case study, we apply our methodology to characterize Brazil in terms of gender balance in STEM as well as to correlate the results using Facebook Ads data with official Brazilian government numbers. Our results suggest that even considering a biased population where the majority is female, the proportion of men interested in some majors is higher than the proportion of women. Within STEM areas, we can identify two different patterns. Life Science and Math/Physical Sciences have female dominance, Environmental Science, Technology, and Engineering majors are still concentrated towards men. We also assess the impact of educational level and age on the interest in majors the gender gap in STEM increases with the women's educational level and age, as confirmed by official data in Brazil. © 2021 ACM.","Social media; Social networks; Sociology","Engineering education; Environmental technology; Social networking (online); World Wide Web; Biased populations; Educational levels; Environmental science; Industrial revolutions; Less developed countries; Life-sciences; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; World economy; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Araujo, M., Mejova, Y., Weber, I., Benevenuto, F., Using facebook ads audiences for global lifestyle disease surveillance: Promises and limitations (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 Acm on Web Science Conference, pp. 253-257; Botella, C., Rueda, S., Lopez-Iñesta, E., Marzal, P., 2019 Gender Diversity in STEM Disciplines: A Multiple Factor Problem (2019) Entropy, 21 (1), p. 30. , https://doi.org/10.3390/e21010030, Jan; Christie, M., Neill, M.O., Rutter, K., Young, G., Medland, A., Understanding why women are under-represented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) within Higher Education: A regional case study (2017) Production, 27, p. 2017; Clewell, B., Campbell, P., Taking stock: Where we?ve been, where we are, where we?re going (2002) Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering; Ertl, B., Luttenberger, S., Paechter, M., (2017) 2017 the Impact of Gender Stereotypes on the Self-Concept of Female Students in Stem Subjects with An Under-Representation of Females.

We find that higher rank in math increases the likelihood of choosing STEM and decreases the likelihood of choosing Arts and Social Sciences. Similarly, a higher rank in English leads to an increase in the probability of choosing Arts and Social Sciences and decreases the probability of choosing STEM. The effects of subject ranks on STEM are larger for boys than girls while there is no evidence of a gender difference in the effect of subject ranks on Arts and Social Sciences. We also find that English and math rank can explain about 4% of the gender gap in the choice of STEM as a college major and 9% of the gender gap that is not explained by absolute achievement. Overall, the tendency for girls to be higher ranked in English and lower ranked in math within school-cohorts can explain about 10% of the difference in the STEM gender gap between mixed-sex schools and same-sex schools and about 25% of the difference that is unexplained by absolute achievement. Notably, these effects occur even though we control for an extensive set of measures of absolute achievement at the end of high school, and the institutional setup implies that within-school rank plays no role whatsoever in college admissions decisions. © 2021",,,,,,,"University of Manchester; National University of Ireland, Galway, OÉ Gaillimh; European University Institute, EUI; Norges Forskningsråd; Helmholtz International Center for FAIR: 262675","We are grateful to the Central Applications Office for providing access to the data used in this paper and to the State Examinations Commission for helpful information.

Game jams are a form of game creation: events where games are made in co-operation. They are widely used in game design education and in addition, when participated voluntarily, learning has been reported as an important motivation. The existing literature mostly concentrates on game jams for adults, and informal or non-formal learning. This article is adding to the literature by examining learning in formal education for adolescents. As part of our research, we have organised game jams in formal general education, and this article is based on the pre-event and post-event surveys of three game jam events. The article maps 1) the motivations to attend a school related game jam, 2) the expectations and apprehensions the would-be participants have, 3) what kind of learning game jams promote, and 4) how does attending a game jam affect participants’ attitudes and apprehensions regarding learning, STEAM and information technology, and their own skills. Our results indicate the creative side of digital game making, desire to learn new skills and make new friends to be the main motivations for participation, and the lack of confidence in technical skills to cause most anxiety before the jam event. The effects of attending a game jam are mostly positive, with the participants reporting learning experiences in several soft and technical skills and increased motivation to take part in creative and co-creative projects. A gendered result can be seen in the participants’ altered stance on technology and programming: girls and non-binary students report technology and programming being easier and more fun than they had thought before attending a game jam event, which is well in line with previous research on STEM/STEAM education and gender. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adolescents; Co-creation; Creativity; Game jams; Gender inclusivity; STEAM learning",,,,,,"Academy of Finland, AKA: 312527","This study was funded by the Academy of Finland, Strategic Research Counsil, project Growing Mind, grant number 312527.",,,,,,"Ananiadou, K., Claro, M., 21st century skills and competences for new millennium learners in OECD Countries (2009) OECD Publishing, , OECD Education Working Papers, No. 41; Arya, A., Chastine, J., Preston, J., Fowler, A., An international study on learning and process choices in the Global Game Jam (2013) International Journal of Game-Based Learning, 3 (4), pp. 27-46; Arya, A., Gold, S., Farber, M., Miklasz, K., GGJ-next: The global game jam for youth (2019) ICGJ 2019: Proceedings of the International Conference on Game Jams, Hackathons and Game Creation Events, , https://doi.org/10.1145/3316287.3316289, 2019; Appianing, J., Van Eck, R., Gender differences in college students’ perceptions of technology-related jobs in computer science (2015) International Journal of Gender, Science and Technology, 7 (1), pp. 28-56; Aurava, R., Kankainen, V., Murray, J., Why won’t they jam?

The reform had two important aspects: (i) it equalized all students’ exposure to maths by making advanced maths compulsory in the last two years of high school; and (ii) increased the instruction time from three to four hours per week and increased the level of instruction in maths and the natural sciences for some 80% of students, more so for females than for males. Our results suggest that, despite its substantial nature, the reform did not change the share of men completing STEM degrees but reduced the share of women graduating from STEM programmes. Moreover, we do not find general reform effects on the share of individuals working in STEM occupations after graduation for both men and women. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Academic degrees; gender differences; occupational choice",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allensworth, E., Nomi, T., Montgomery, N., Lee, V.E., College Preparatory Curriculum for All: Academic Consequences of Requiring Algebra and English I for Ninth Graders in Chicago (2009) Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 31 (4), pp. 367-391; Altonji, J., Blom, E., Meghir, C., Heterogeneity in Human Capital Investments: High School Curriculum, College Majors, and Careers (2012) Annual Review of Economics, 4 (1), pp. 185-223; Altonji, J.G., The Effects of High School Curriculum on Education and Labor Market Outcomes (1995) Journal of Human Resources, 30 (3), pp. 409-438; Ardicianono, P., Ability Sorting and the Returns to College Major (2004) Journal of Econometrics, 121 (1-2), pp. 343-375; Aughinbaugh, A., The Effects of High School Math Curriculum on College Attendance: Evidence from the NLSY97 (2012) Economics of Education Review, 31 (6), pp. 861-870; Baillet, F., Franken, A., Weber, A., (2017) DZHW-Absolventenpanel 2005.

Using data from 2006 to 2015 Labour Force Survey for Poland, I show that men and women with the same education value their qualifications differently, which points to behavioural differences by gender. The gender difference in returns to education fields is found to be the single most important predictor of the gender gap in reservation wages. Women educated in mathematics, IT and physics are found to report higher reservation wages than other women and there is no difference in pay expectations between them and men. The results contribute to the discussion on the importance of a higher presence of women in STEM fields as a way of achieving greater gender equality in the labour markets. © 2021 The Author(s).

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) are the core subject areas that will develop innovations directly related to everyday life. There are a lot of products and services created from the knowledge of STEM. STEM competencies are key in a society that wishes to reach high levels of productivity and competitiveness. STEM skills support a range of high-end activities such as the discovery of new energy sources, improvement of supercomputing capabilities, and advances in artificial intelligence (AI). It also plays a role in enhancing the Internet of Things technology, which will improve a patient’s quality of life and ultimately, propose solutions to the most urgent and complex challenges of our time. The European Union is a global leader in gender equality, but there are still several stereotypes that need to be challenged. According to a report from the European Institute for Gender Equality, achieving gender equality in STEM topics could add 1.2 million jobs to the job market, increasing Europe’s GDP to between €610–820 billion by 2050. According to the State of Women-Owned Businesses Report 2019 (American Express), the number of female entrepreneurs has grown, with the number of businesses owned by women increasing by 114% over the past 20 years. STEM education has become a priority for leaders around the world as it creates a globalized economy based on knowledge and technology. According to OECD reports, engagement with STEM topics encourages innovation by educating young people in critical thinking and the use of evidence for decision-making purposes. In the near future, the most sought-after professionals in the job market will be trained in innovation, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, problem solving, and the application of knowledge to real-life problems. This study is focused on analyzing the characteristics of women entrepreneurs in STEM fields in Europe. It will try to identify the main differences between the European countries in terms of their characteristics, policies, challenges, and barriers. The analysis will be covering a range of economic, social, psychological, and educational variables. A range of different sources was used, e.g., Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), WDBD Database, and Eurostat. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","European countries; Female entrepreneurship; STEM fields",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Banchi, H., Bell, R., The many levels of inquiry (2008) Science and Children, , http://static.nsta.org/files/sc0810_26.pdf, Retrieved from; Cheryan, S., Master, A., Meltzoff, A.N., Cultural stereotypes as gatekeepers: Increasing girls’ interest in computer science and engineering by diversifying stereotypes (2015) Front Psychol, 6 (49). , https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00049; Crosnoe R, Riegle-Crumb C, Frank K, Field S, Muller C (2008) Peer group contexts of girls’ and boys’ academic experience.

Previous literature offers some explanation for this gender imbalance, but there has been limited qualitative data to provide an in-depth understanding of existing quantitative findings. This study explores the lived experiences of female computer science students and how they experience the male dominated learning environment. Female computer science students from eight universities were interviewed (n = 23) and data were analysed using template analysis. Whilst these women have not been troubled by their sense of fit at university, a combination of stereotypical assumptions of male superiority in this field, and a masculine, agentic learning environment, has left them feeling less technologically capable and less motivated. The findings are discussed in terms of Cheryan et al.’s tripartite model for women’s participation in STEM (2017) and we recommend that computer science departments should consider feminist pedagogy to ensure that all learners can be well supported. © 2021, The Author(s).","Agentic learners; Communal learners; Computer science students; Occupational fit; STEM gender imbalance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acker, J., Hierarchies, jobs, bodies: A theory of gendered organizations (1990) Gender & Society, 4 (2), pp. 139-158; Appianing, J., Van Eck, R.N., Gender differences in college students’ perceptions of technology-related jobs in computer science (2015) International Journal of Gender, Science and Technology, 7 (1), p. 2015; Aylor, B., The impact of sex, gender, and cognitive complexity on the perceived importance of teacher communication skills (2003) Communication Studies, 54 (4), pp. 496-509; Ayre, M., Mills, J., Gill, J., Yes, I do belong”: The women who stay in engineering (2013) Engineering Studies; Bakan, D., (1966) The Duality of Human Existence: an Essay on Psychology and Religion, , Chicago: Rand McNally; Barker, L.J., Aspray, W., The state of research on girls and IT (2006) Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation, pp. 3-54. , J.

The Spanish case reflects a deep division by gender in access to different professional careers with masculinized enrollments in most of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) degrees and a feminization of the Social Sciences and Humanities degrees. Behind this division there are social and cultural elements, but there are also other motivations that could be behind the rejection of women to these studies that are going to be widely demanded by the labor market in the future.

With increasing numbers of women pursuing PhDs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, it is critical to examine how PhD programs contribute to the career paths of PhDs. This study examines the role of doctoral education preparation in communication, management, and technical skills, as well as post-PhD early career management training (ECMT), on PhDs’ attainment of leadership positions in industry. Data come from the National Science Foundation Survey of Doctorate Recipients, National Science Foundation Survey of Earned Doctorates, and National Research Council Rankings of PhD programs. Using regression analyses, results indicate that ECMT is associated with a higher likelihood of attainment of leadership positions. PhD preparation in management skills also contributes to the attainment of leadership positions. Previous literature has shown that structural inequities and workplace bias contribute to limiting women’s progress to leadership positions and that it is critical to address systemic and workplace biases. Research findings suggest that PhD program preparation and increased access to professional development opportunities can help contribute to the enhancement of women’s pathways to leadership roles. Structural changes in doctoral education preparation in management skills and increases in ECMT opportunities offered by employers also have the potential to increase the participation of STEM PhDs in leadership roles in industry. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Doctoral education; Gender; Industry; Leadership",,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1653378","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1653378.

While previous explanations emphasize the importance of individual preferences or family socialization, less is known about how the school context contributes to these differences. This study aimed to examine the role of the classroom context as a frame of reference for students’ career expectations, focusing on comparative and normative reference group effects. Building on gender socialization theory and rational choice models, I investigate whether these contextual effects affect students’ occupational expectations in a gender-specific way. Drawing on a large representative sample of secondary school students in Germany, I find that the gender gap in students’ occupational expectations is larger in classrooms characterized by a high mathematical confidence and high aspirations toward STEM. In classrooms with a pronounced STEM-related classroom climate, female students less frequently expect to work in a STEM career, while for male students the same classroom climate is associated with higher expectations toward STEM. More generally, this study demonstrates that research on the explanation of gender differences in career expectations profits from incorporating social context effects within schools and classrooms. © 2020 The Author(s).

Background: Understanding the motivation of choosing engineering studies is very important in order to strengthen this choice in future promotions in Spain, considering that it is well below the average of the European Union at the present time. Research Questions: What are the main factors that influence students to choose engineering studies? Are there any noticeable differences between those affecting male and female students? Methodology: Data were collected from a survey completed by 624 students and an exploratory study was performed extracting five components. Independent sample <formula> <tex>$T$</tex> </formula> -tests were used to determine significant differences between the answers of males and females. Findings: The factors found in the exploratory analysis were ``Interest and development,'' ``Career advice and previous contact,'' ``Outcome expectations,'' ``Social influences'' and ``Not preferred option.'' Significant differences between the answers given by males and females were also found. The outcome of this study is important for the development of new interventions aimed to increase interest, enrollment, and retention of engineering students, especially among females.

Yet, little attention has been paid to the impact of an MP’s occupational and educational background, especially with regards to having a STEM background (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). Therefore, the current study investigates the effect of having a STEM educational and/or occupational background on both the likelihood of MPs proposing a STEM Private Member’s Bill (PMB) and the proportion of PMB proposals an MP dedicates to STEM bills. Focussing on the 2015–2017 UK Parliament, we find that having a STEM background does not affect the likelihood of proposing a STEM PMB (or not) but combining an educational and occupational STEM background significantly increases the proportion of an MP’s PMB proposals dedicated to STEM bills. This effect is stronger for the co-sponsors of PMBs than for the primary presenters. We also find that having a STEM educational background matters more strongly for women than for men, and that the level of education in an MP’s constituency also affects the link between having a STEM background and the proportion of submitted STEM PMBs. Our findings highlight the substantive consequences of having a diverse parliament, also in terms of educational and occupational backgrounds. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Legislative behaviour; Members of Parliament; Private Member's Bill; STEM; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mission [online] (2020) 314 Action., , https://314action.org/mission-1, Accessed 11 Mar 2020; Adamic, L.A., Wei, X., Yang, J., Gerrish, S., Nam, K.K., Clarkson, G.S., Individual focus and knowledge contribution (2010) First Monday, 15 (3), pp. 1-10; Allen, P., (2018) The political class: Why it matters who our politicians are, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Asiedu, E.C., Branstette, N., Gaekwad-Babulalmalokele, N., The effect of women’s representation in parliament and the passing of gender sensitive policies (2018) ASSA Annual Meeting (Philadelphia, 5–7 January)., , https://www.aeaweb.org/conference, Accessed 16 Dec 2019; Aydemir, N., Vliegenthart, R., Tracing roots of group representation among MPs with immigrant backgrounds: A content analysis on parliamentary questions in the Netherlands (2021) Ethnicities; Baker, C., Spreadsheets: City and town classification of constituencies, local authorities and output areas [online] (2018) House of Commons Library., , https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8322, Accessed 07 Dec 2020; Bego, K.J., Pilkingtongoujon, C., Only 9% of GE2017 contenders have a STEM degree: Why this is a problem [online] (2017) Nesta., , https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/only-9-of-ge2017-contenders-have-a-stem-degree-why-this-is-a-problem, Accessed 16 Jan 2021; Besley, T.J., Pande, R., Rao, V., (2005) Political selection and the quality of government: Evidence from South India, p. 5201. , Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), Discussion Paper No, London; Bowler, S., Private members' bills in the UK parliament: Is there an ‘electoral connection’?

Our analyses on the graduates who obtained a Master of Science degree in the 2005–2009 period from Politecnico di Milano reveal that training in economics and management reduces the gender imbalance in entrepreneurial entry among STEM recent graduates.

The study argues that measures of children’s capability in mathematics must include some indicators of attitudes toward the subject. These are particularly important when analyzing gender gaps because attitudes toward mathematics differ by gender. To this end, the study first analyzes the gender gap in attitudes and test scores separately using school fixed effects models. Second, it estimates a structural equation model, which takes into account that mathematical capability is a latent construct for which some indicators (test scores and attitudes) are observed. Using data from the Italian National Institute for the Evaluation of Education Systems (INVALSI) for school years 5 and 10 in 2014 and 2015, results confirm that when mathematics capability, including both attitudes and test scores, is measured, the gap between boys and girls changes, and it is therefore relevant to consider both concepts. HIGHLIGHTS Italy has one of the highest gender gaps in mathematics in the OECD. Gender gaps are substantial both in children's attitudes and their test scores. Tackling gender stereotypes may improve women's self-confidence in mathematics and the gender gap in scores. This may also help close the gender gap in STEM occupations. © 2021 IAFFE.","attitudes; Math gender gap; school achievement; structural equation models",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Addabbo, T., Di Tommaso, M.L., Maccagnan, A., Gender Differences in Italian Children’s Capabilities (2014) Feminist Economics, 20 (2), pp. 90-121; Allport, G.W., Attitudes (1935) A Handbook of Social Psychology, pp. 798-844. , Murchinson C.A., (ed), Worcester, MA: Clark University Press,. edited by; Anelli, M., Peri, G., Gender Gap in Italy: The Role of College-Majors (2015) Unexplored Dimensions of Discriminations, pp. 79-106. , Boeri T., Patacchini E., Peri G., (eds), Oxford: Oxford University Press, and,. edited by; Aragonés-González, M., Rosser-Limiñana, A., Gil-González, D., Coeducation and Gender Equality in Education Systems: A Scoping Review (2020) Children and Youth Services Review, 111, p. 104837. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.104837; Ballard, C., Johnson, M., Gender, Expectations and Grades in Introductory Microeconomics at a US University (2005) Feminist Economics, 11 (1), pp. 95-122; Blau, F.D., Kahn, L.M., Gender Differences in Pay (2000) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 14 (4), pp. 75-99; Cassidy, R., Cattan, S., Crawford, C., Dytham, S., (2018), https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/R149.pdf, How Can We Increase Girls’ Uptake of Mathematics and Physics A-Level?

One reason for this are gender-related stereotypes that still persist in many modern cultures, which associate STEM as being a “male” domain. To actively draw young women towards STEM and Computer Science, we design a workshop for girls in the age group of 10th grade in secondary education. This workshop introduces the girls to machine learning in the application context of fashion and shopping. We define both cognitive and affective learning objectives and corresponding observable outcomes that indicate whether the learning objectives were reached or not. Based on these learning objectives, we develop a didactic concept for our workshop, as well as a web application as a front end for the machine learning application. Finally, we execute a pilot run of our workshop, which we evaluate with respect to participant satisfaction and the achievement of the learning objectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Gender gap; Girls in CS; K12 education; Machine learning; STEM education","Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Machine learning; Affective learning; Age groups; Application contexts; Higher education; Learning objectives; Machine learning applications; On-machines; WEB application; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, L.W., Krathwohl, D.R., Airasian, P.W., Cruikshank, K.A., Mayer, R.E., Pintrich, P.R., Raths, J., Wittrock, M.C.: A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching, and Assessing, 1st edn.

This objective is part of the european CREATEskills project. On the basis of an exploratory and non-experimental research design, two validated questionnaires were used through a dual procedure (expert judgment and pilot study). The results indicate that teachers demand additional resources and training for STEM teaching, while students prefer to use digital resources and conduct experimental work.

Yet, little is known about the differential effects of various online mentoring formats. We examine the general and relative effectiveness of three online mentoring formats, one-on-one mentoring, many-to-many group mentoring, and a hybrid form of the two. All three formats were implemented in different years in the Germany-wide online-only mentoring program, CyberMentor, whose platform enables communication and networking between up to 800 girls (in grades 5-13) and 800 women (STEM professionals) each year. We combined longitudinal mentee data for all first-year participants (N = 4017 girls, Mage  = 14.15 years) from 9 consecutive mentoring years to evaluate and compare the three mentoring formats. Overall, all formats effected comparable increases in mentees' STEM activities and certainty about career plans. However, mentees' communication behavior and networking behavior on the mentoring platform differed between the three formats. Mentees in the hybrid mentoring format showed the most extensive STEM-related communication and networking on the platform. We also analyzed the explanatory contributions of STEM-related communication and networking on interindividual differences in the developmental trajectories of mentees' STEM activities, elective intentions in STEM, and certainty about career plans, for each format separately. © 2020 The Authors.

I interpret this as suggestive evidence that one’s perceived ability in mathematics, a boy-dominated subject, decreases when the share of male classmates increases.

According to the Ministry of Education in Spain, the percentage of women in computer science studies in 2018-2019 was 12.93%. This study aims to analyze the perception of computing students concerning the gender gap in computer science studies. In particular, the study was carried out in two Spanish universities located in different regions (N=95). © 2020 IEEE.","computer science; gender gap; higher education; quantitative study","Education computing; Students; Developed countries; European union; Higher education; Large parts; Ministry of Education; Professional fields; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Engineering education",,,,,"European Commission, EC","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is part of the teaching innovation project ""Actions in favor of diversity in the technological field.

Physics education for STEM education should then involve learning sequences featuring modelling activities with computational knowledge and technologies. Such sequences should manifest epistemological and cognitive balance between theory, experimentation and computation, be interactively collaborative, and ensure the development of meaningful knowledge in physics, mathematics and scientific computation, appropriately considering the diversity of STEM contexts. To address this challenge we have proposed an approach based on the creation of sequences of interactive engagement learning activities with computational modelling that explore different kinds of modelling, introduce scientific computation progressively, generate and resolve cognitive conflicts in the understanding of physics and mathematics, and comparatively analyze the various complementary representations of the mathematical models of physics. In this work we discuss a learning sequence about fluid mechanics for introductory physics students of STEM university courses, during which they built and explored in the computer mathematical physics models and animations helping them resolve difficulties persisting after theoretical lectures and problem-solving paper and pen activities. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Starting from the intersection between coding, digital fabrication, STEM education and disability, we present Design for ALL.L, a framework to create social inclusion through project-based learning programs. The presented framework targets students of different ages, from elementary to university, and guides the development of educational programs to foster awareness and empowerment for people with disabilities at different levels: from developing interaction design projects to meet the special needs of people with disabilities, to rethinking student-Teacher interaction as the person with disabilities becomes teacher. Learning from the two case studies described in this paper, we provide insights and reflections on the opportunities and challenges to bridge the goal of social inclusion for people with disability with education through technology. © 2020 ACM.","Design for all; digital fabrication; disability; project-based learning; stem","Computer applications; Computer programming; Digital fabrication; Educational experiences; Educational program; Interaction design; People with disabilities; Project based learning; Social inclusion; Student teachers; Students",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61873163","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61873163.",,,,,,"Kroll, H., Conlé, M., Schuller, M., China: Innovation system and innovation policy (2008) New Challenges for Germany in the Innovation Competition, 169; Huang, J., Rozelle, S., Zhu, X., Zhao, S., Sheng, Y., Agricultural and rural development in China during the past four decades: An introduction (2020) Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics, , https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12352; Zhu, X., Zhao, H., Recognition of innovation and diffusion of welfare policy: Alleviating urban poverty in Chinese cities during fiscal recentralization (2018) Governance, 31 (4), pp. 721-739. , https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.12332; Fu, J., Li, S., Ng, A.W., Challenges and Countermeasures in the Development of China?s Green Bond Market (2020) Sustainable Energy and Green Finance for A Low-carbon Economy (Pp. 47-63, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35411-4_3, Springer, Cham; Zhang, M., Song, Y., Cai, X., Zhou, J., Economic assessment of the health effects related to particulate matter pollution in 111 Chinese cities by using economic burden of disease analysis (2008) Journal of Environmental Management, 88 (4), pp. 947-954. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.04.019; Loyalka, P., Liu, L., Chen, G., Zheng, X., The cost of disability in China (2014) Demography, 51 (1), pp. 97-118. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-013-0272-7; Wu, A., Cao, H., Koeppe, (2019) Inclusion at Work.

In Japan, a big gender gap in STEM subjects in high school translates into low numbers of female students studying science at university and low admission rates of females to national universities for which all applicants for all degrees are required to sit an exam in science. But role models do exist to encourage the younger generation, and some national universities are trying hard to encourage more female students to study science, technology, and mathematics. Interviews with three role models who took science degrees and went on to successful careers in academia, finance, and consumer electronics, show that barriers are considerable but that they can be overcome.

The percentages of women completing higher education in STEM, working in the sector and moving up in the organisation are lower than those of men. This work presents a qualitative study of multimedia data carried out in Spain during 2020. The aim is to analyse the experience and perspectives of professional women in the STEM sector. Twenty-one women from different organisations and qualifications, all associated with science, technology, engineering and mathematics, participated in the study. The study has been developed within the framework of the project W-STEM - Building the future of Latin America: engaging women into STEM. The video interviews were analysed using the qualitative data support software webQDA. After defining the categories and categorising the discourse, a classical content analysis was carried out. The results obtained reveal the need to invest more energy in strategies to raise the profile of women in the sector. All of them feel a strong attraction for their studies and their profession, however, they think that the path is difficult and there is little visibility. Furthermore, all the participants encourage girls to try out STEM careers if they feel they are their vocation. © 2020 ACM.","Gender gap; qualitative research; Spain; STEM; Vocations; Women","Ecosystems; Employment; Professional aspects; Content analysis; Higher education; Latin America; Multi-media analysis; Multimedia data; Qualitative data; Qualitative study; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: FPU017/01252; European Commission, EC","This research work has been carried out within the University of Salamanca PhD Programme on Education in the Knowledge Society scope (http://knowledgesociety.usal.es) [12, 13], and this research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Inovación y Universidades under a FPU fellowship (FPU017/01252).","This work has been possible with the support of the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union in its Key Action 2 “Capacity-building in Higher Education”.

Overall, gender representation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics degrees in Europe is not balanced. The Leaky Pipeline phenomenon, marked by gender stereotypes, makes the latent gender gap a relevant topic of study. Studies exist on academic performance, self-perception, self-efficacy, outcome expectations; however, studying gender stereotypes linked to STEM studies is also essential. It is necessary to know the social and family context in which young people have grown up, as well as their perception of such studies. To study gender stereotypes of university students about STEM studies, a questionnaire has been designed for empirical validation. For the design of the instrument, to be validated, items from other instruments have been taken and adapted to Spanish. After the design of the instrument, an online pilot study has been applied in the University of Salamanca, the University of Valencia and the Polytechnic University of Valencia. A total of 115 people answered the questionnaire. The results of the pilot study reveal that the study sample is not particularly marked by gender stereotypes about gender equality in STEM. Also, the sample is receptive to learning about science and applying it in their lives. On the other hand, the idea that women have to give up their studies and careers to look after their families and children is rejected. The idea that men are more interested in university studies than women is also rejected. At the same time, the sample is aware of the difficulties that women encounter in the STEM sector. Another optimistic point of the results is that there are no alarming data on bad experiences due to gender. In the future, the study will be replicated on a larger scale. © 2020 ACM.","gender gap; gender roles; gender stereotypes; leaky pipeline; Questionnaire; STEM","Ecosystems; Students; Surveys; Academic performance; Empirical validation; Gender equality; Gender stereotypes; Higher education; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; University students; Young peoples; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: FPU017/01252","This research work has been carried out within the University of Salamanca PhD Programme on Education in the Knowledge Society scope (http://knowledgesociety.usal.es) [14, 15], and this research was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades under a FPU fellowship (FPU017/01252).",,,,,,"Atkins, K., Dougan, B.M., Dromgold-Sermen, M.S., Looking at myself in the future"": How mentoring shapes scientific identity for stem students from underrepresented groups (2020) International Journal of Stem Education, 7 (1). , https://doi.org/10.1186/s40594-020-00242-3; Blizzard, J., Klotz, L., Potvin, G., Using survey questions to identify and learn more about those who exhibit design thinking traits (2015) Design Studies, 38, pp. 92-110. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2015.02.002; Broughton, N., Market Foundation, S., (2013) The Balance: The Stem Human Capital Crunch; Cerinsek, G., Hribar, T., Glodez, N., Which are my future career priorities and what influenced my choice of studying science, technology, engineering or mathematics?

However, there still exists a notable gap in STEM education participation according to gender. This quantitative research work aims to know the attitudes towards gender equality and coeducation shown by Compulsory Secondary Education students (grades 7 to 10). The sample was composed by 335 students aged 12-16 from three different secondary education schools located in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León. In order to gather data on student attitudes towards gender, we applied an anonymous questionnaire using a valid and reliable instrument. The descriptive and inferential analysis results show relatively low levels of sexist attitudes among the students participating in the study, although some differences can be found according to the gender of the respondent. Generally, women hold attitudes that are more positive towards gender equality than those held by men. The discussion and conclusions address the need to continue this research line on factors related to gender issues, as well as to implement interventions based on the principles of coeducation, so that our education system, and thus our society, come closer to a real gender equality, thus improving the chances of women to undertake all kinds of studies and jobs. © 2020 ACM.","attitudes; coeducation; Gender equality; gender roles; gender stereotypes; sexism; teenagers","Ecosystems; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Education systems; Gender equality; Gender issues; Gender roles; Quantitative research; STEM education; Student attitudes; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Varela, N., (2013) Feminismo Para Principiantes, , Zeta Bolsillo, Barcelona; Cabeza Leiva, A., Importancia De La coeducación en los centros educativos (2010) Pedagogía Magna, 8, pp. 39-45; Amurrio, M., Larrinaga, A., Usategui, E., Del Valle, A.I., Los estereotipos de género en los/las jóvenes y adolescentes.

The reasons are manifold, including the lack of interest of girls because of existing stereotypes of male nerds, misconceptions in the field of computer science, and concrete differences in students' self-concept and performance. Girls do not choose schools or studies in the field of computer science because working on computers or coding is unattractive to them. Research shows poorer performance, missing interest, and lower self-concept for girls in secondary computing education as well as a high dropout rate of female students in computer science courses at the bachelor's level. Software development exams contribute to those high dropout rates, and women often choose a different subject or even stop their university education altogether. This leads to fewer female employees in the field of computer science, and this situation calls for special measures at several levels. The current paper provides an overview of the initiatives of our university that aim to address several aspects of the gender gap. The programs offered aim to (1) increase interest in computer science and recruit (highly) gifted girls for our talent programs, (2) recruit and support female bachelor's and master's students in computer science, and (3) redesign programming courses and teaching materials to reduce the gender gap in performance and support, especially for female students. This study also describes a cyber tutoring program in which highly gifted girls between 13 and 16 years collaborate with and are supervised by female role models in higher positions in STEM. The evaluation results gained in the first year of this case study are promising and suggest that the extension and further development of the program would be advantageous. © 2020 IEEE.","computer science; gender gap; STEM; talents promotion","Computer programming; Curricula; Engineering education; Software design; Students; Teaching; Computer Science course; Computer scientists; Computing education; Evaluation results; Female students; Programming course; Teaching materials; University education; Education computing",,,,,,,,,,,,"Gardenswartz, L., Rowe, A., Diverse teams at work: Capitalizing on the power of diversity (2003) Society for Human Resource Management, , https://books.google.at/booksid=8UXyAAAAMAAJ; Gap, G.G., (2017) World Economic Forum, , Cologny/Geneva; Han, S.W., National education systems and gender gaps in stem occupational expectations (2016) International Journal of Educational Development, 49, pp. 175-187; Rasmussen, B., Hapnes, T., (2003) Gendering Technology: Young Girls Negotiating ICT and Gender, pp. 173-197. , Merete Lie (ed ), He, She and IT-Revisited (Oslo: Gyldendal Akademiske; Lehman, K.J., Sax, L.J., Zimmerman, H.B., Women planning to major in computer science: Who are they and what makes them unique (2016) Computer Science Education, 26 (4), pp. 277-298. , https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08993408.2016.1271536, Dec; Sax, L.J., (2015) The Gender Gap in College: Maximizing the Developmental Potential of Women and Men, , John Wiley & Sons; Sax, L.J., Kanny, M.A., Riggers-Piehl, T.A., Whang, H., Paulson, L.N., But I'm not good at math: The changing salience of mathematical self-concept in shaping women's and men's stem aspirations (2015) Research in Higher Education, 56 (8), pp. 813-842. , Dec; Lagesen, V.A., Getting women into computer science (2011) Technologies of Inclusion.

It stems from an interest in the kind of interventions that academia should address in order to reduce gender segregation and provide women and men with the same educational opportunities and personal development. In relation to the obvious and continuing gender differences along a horizontal dimension, previous research seems to have had a limited impact in breaking gender stereotypes and promoting women and men to more atypical fields. The empirical data consists of 25 semi-structured, individual interviews from underrepresented students' gender-related experiences/thoughts about their programmes. By using the concepts of “visibility,” “sense of belonging,” and “negotiating otherness” to analyze how negotiation and belonging are part of students' everyday university lives this study's most important contributions are its findings regarding the differentiations in visibility. A continuum of visibility experiences is explored, from men who receive positive attention to women who are being considered as less knowledgeable. Our visibility scale indicates, as does previous research, that there are differences between how female and male students become visible, but the differences can also appear within both groups of students. This knowledge is crucial when designing interventions so as to provide positive study environments for both women and men. Also—in a broader perspective—it is important in order to recruit and ensure that gender minority students remain in the programs. © Copyright © 2020 Heikkilä, Isaksson and Stranne.","experiences; gender minority; gender segregation; higher education; negotiating otherness; sense of belonging; visibility",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beech, N., On the nature of dialogic identity work (2008) Organization, 15, pp. 51-74; Berg, B.L., Lune, H., (2012) Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, , 8th Edn, Pearson; Block, K., (2015) Men Don't Care for Caring: Fundamental Goals and Men's Interest in HEED Roles, , The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies.

This study presents a demographic investigation of human factors and behaviors affecting women in the DHM field. A questionnaire composed of several items was set up to analyze the situation: demographic map of women in DHM (age, country, and level of education), the field of application, factors related to career progression, and correct instruments to change the current situation of underrepresentation. Our results show a gap of women working in the DHM field in the industry or research institutes (21% and 8% respectively). While, the 56% are involved in the Academic world, with a 30% PhD and 26% PostDoc level. Work-life-balance (WLB), career progress (CP), family-balance vs career (FB VS C), and work schedule flexibility (WSF) resulted lower in women of 30-34 and 35-39 years old. As a result, it is necessary to adopt strategies focus on support mentoring programs, career progress, childcare support, and flexible work schedule aiming to eliminate women inequality and stigmatization. This will open up borders in Academics, Industry, and Research education closing the gap in the DHM field. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.","DHM; DHMW; Gender Balance; Modelling; STEM; Women","Behavioral research; Population statistics; Scheduling; Career progression; Digital human modelling; International group; Level of educations; Mentoring programs; Research institutes; Science , technology , engineering , and maths; Work-life balance; Professional aspects",,,,,"Universiteit Antwerpen","This work was supported by University of Sk?vde (Synergy Virtual Ergonomics project) and the University of Antwerp.

Being part of a spacecraft mission science team can be considered a proxy to measure the ""success""in the field. Participation of women in PI (Principal Investigators) teams varied between 4% and 25 %, with several missions with no women as PI. The percentage of female scientists as Co-I (Co-Investigators) is always less than 16 %. This number is lower than the percentage of women in the International Astronomical Union from all ESA's Member State (24 %), which can give us an indication of the percentage of women in the field. We encountered many difficulties to gather the data for this study. The list of team members were not always easily accessible. An additional difficulty was to determine the percentage of female scientists in planetary science in Europe. We would like to encourage the planetary community as a whole, as well as international organizations, universities and societies to continuously gather statistics over many years. Detailed statistics are only the first step to closely monitor the development of achievement gaps and initiate measures to tackle potential causes of inequity, leading to gender inequalities in STEM careers. © Author(s) 2020.",,"academic research; astronomy; gender identity; gender issue; historical perspective; participatory approach; satellite mission; womens status",,,,,"Islamic Azad University, IAU","We would like to thank Robert Massey and an anonymous reviewer for their comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

How can young people be guided to grasp the essence, potential and social implications of new quantum technologies? This paper presents how the research group in physics education of the University of Bologna is addressing the challenge launched by Quantum Manifesto and is approaching the issue of designing teaching materials on quantum technologies aimed to enable secondary school students to grapple with the second quantum revolution. © Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"de Touzalin, A., Marcus, C., Heijman, F., Cirac, I., Murray, R., Calarco, T., (2016) Quantum Manifesto; Riedel Max, F., (2017) Quantum Sci.

Nevertheless, when we see these behaviors in our young learners, we try to shut it down (Ripley, 2016) and call them misbehaving students or troublemakers. Many teachers, for example, value compliant originality and conforming behavior over independent thinking (Beghetto, 2016). Kids will defy; the ones who can make productive use of it will become successful and productive members of society. Negative classroom management styles like suspension are often used due to what the teacher interprets as misbehavior (c.f., Lewis et al., 2008). Unfortunately, a large number of students, who are defiant and do not have the tools to adept, do disengage, lose interest and drop out of school. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Classroom management; Drop-out; New solutions; STEM education; Teachers' views; Value innovations; Western societies; Students",,,,,,,,,,,,"Abel, M.

For the case of female students, in some countries the situation can be even more complicated as cultural issues might be involved. In this work, we present the results of more than ten year of experience in the attraction of female students to Engineering programs such as Mechatronics Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science into a private University. The strategies presented in this paper are focused on the Southern Region of Mexico. This region presents the lowest index of human development according to United Nations results. Different problems have been faced by the attraction team since the opening of our university campus in 2003, ranging from funding to the difficult cultural issues such as the case when an Engineering degree is not considered as a women's career choice in some regions of the country. The paper shows the trends in several Engineering programs with a positive increase in the number of girls pursuing an Engineering major. Some of the best strategies are included along with the kind of activities that have worked best for attracting more women into Engineering. Also, recommendations on how to help them overcome peer and family pressure are described. The conclusions and recommendations of this work can be used in other emerging economies that are working in increasing the number of women in STEM programs. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,"Students; Emerging economies; Engineering and computer science; Engineering degrees; Engineering program; Female students; Index of human development; University campus; Women's careers; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Human Development Reports, , http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/MEX, United Nations Development Programme, Country Profile: Mexico, retrieved from; Keune, Anna, Peppler, Kylie A., Wohlwend, Karen E., Recognition in makerspaces: Supporting opportunities for women to 'make' a STEM career Computers in Human Behavior (2019), 99, pp. 368-380. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.05.013, Pages ISSN 0747-5632; Sassler, Sharon, Glass, Jennifer, Levitte, Yael, Michelmore, Katherine M., The missing women in STEM?

This form of segregation, due to both enduring gender stereotypes and the peculiar structure of the Italian education system, tends to exclude women from the more requested professions. The lack of further education policies and targeted interventions in support of a transition from school to work for young people, makes for endemic school-work mismatch affecting the entire students supply chain by creating a dual male-female labour market in the economy 4.0. The purpose of this work was to develop a best practice in order to bridge the gender gap in the STEM area, both at school and later in the workplace. Results of the action research project named “STEM Women: A Challenge for the School, an Opportunity for Businesses, a Search for Talents”, covered the Piedmont Region. An operational network was set up, including representatives from universities, public institutions, schools and technology enterprises. A survey involving a sample of 572 high school students, evaluated male and female STEM preference, quality of teaching and orientation for future employment. To promote female self-confidence in personal scientific ability and help in deciding to choose a career in STEM, researchers and female leaders from technology Companies were asked to hold meetings at high school level, and visits to STEM firms were organized. In the final stages of the research project, a public meeting was held to enable male and female students to discuss the cultural, economic and social implications of increased female presence in the STEM professions. © 2020, Padova University Press.

During the coding process, three major themes emerged having to do with the experience of learning with others and/or learning in groups. The first theme involved communication within the group and the group's approaches to working together. The second identified specific emotions experienced during group work and motivations participants described having felt. The third centred on learning to navigate diversity, particularly with regard to ethnicity and gender.

Compared to 66 investigated nations, The Netherlands scores highest on gender-stereotypical images of science and engineering and lowest on influx of female students in STEM bachelors. To increase the number of students opting for science and engineering studies, many actions have been taken, one of which is the option to choose a Research and Design track at specific secondary schools (the O&O track at the Technasium schools). Although such efforts have resulted in a higher percentage of girls choosing a STEM-oriented track in secondary school, still only 27% of the girls that start a BA university program enrolls in a STEM-study. Possible reasons for this may relate to the implicit and explicit gender-stereotypical attitudes that prevail in The Netherlands and to a lack of female STEM role models. In this paper, we present the results of a qualitative interview study with pupils and teachers from Research and Design tracks at different secondary schools in The Netherlands. Results show that even in the Research and Design tracks at secondary school, pupils and teachers seem to be unaware of the importance of explicating the low influx of female STEM students and its relation to implicit gender stereotypical images and a lack of female role models. As a consequence, very few female STEM role models are provided to pupils and little conscious effort is put into countering potential gender stereotypes and stimulating girls to choose for science and engineering. © 2020 SEFI 48th Annual Conference Engaging Engineering Education, Proceedings.

Educational robotics can play a relevant role in this process, by providing contexts that involve design, construction and imagination. The STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) approach offers a paradigm, which, by integrating educational robotics with scientific, digital and artistic perspectives, helps to undermine existing racial and gender inequality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and STEAM-related contexts. Some relevant experiences regarding the possibility to combine these fields in educational contexts show promising results. By discussing the most relevant difficulties related to the development of curricula where educational robotics finds a relevant place, this paper argues that the use of robotics as experimented with in the Reggio Emilia Approach allows to overstep most of the difficulties reported. Furthermore, it is argued that in order to be more effective, educational robotics might be considered by teachers not as a subject to teach by providing instructions but, instead, as a medium to allow children to explore the affordances of digital technologies in playful learning environments. Some practical examples of this perspective are reported and discussed in the final part of the paper. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Educational robotics; Playful learning environments; Reggio Emilia Approach; Steam",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Babaci-Wilhite, Z., (2019) Promoting Language and STEAM as Human Rights in Education, , Springer, Singapore; Science education for responsible citizenship: Report to the European Commission of the expert group on science education (2015) Directorate-General for Research and Innovation Science with and for Society: EUR 26893 EN; Does Europe need more STEM graduates.

Less than 30 percent of STEM researchers are women and less than 20 percent of the space workforce comprises women. Achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires increased participation from women in STEM and in the space sector. SDG 4: Quality Education and SDG 5: Gender Equality are specifically focused on these topics. To support the achievement of these goals, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has launched a global Space4Women project, which aims to strengthen awareness, capacity, and skills of individuals and institutions to promote gender equality in the space sector. It also helps to communicate and facilitate access to opportunities in STEM education and the space sector itself. This is achieved through four unique activities: (1) a global Space4Women Network, which brings together female role models and mentors to inspire, guide, encourage, and support women and girls in pursuing STEM education and careers in the space sector; (2) a platform to submit capacity building ideas and needs to facilitate tailored advice, expertise, knowledge, and data to improve access to and use of space; (3) a global discussion forum in which women and girls can share experiences, opportunities, and obstacles about working in the space sector, and exchange information on STEM fields; and (4) annual conferences and events that facilitate multilateral and global dialogue on gender equality in the space sector. To date, the most important lesson learned has been the importance of direct outreach in growing the interest in and support of project activities. Altogether, Space4Women activities provide opportunities to enable, develop, and inspire women and girls to become leaders in the future space workforce. © 2020 by DLR-SART.","Capacity building; Discussion forum; Mentor network; STEM; Women","Knowledge management; Personnel; Professional aspects; Capacity building; Discussion forum; Gender equality; Outer space affairs; Project activities; Quality education; Science , technology , engineering , and mathematics; STEM education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,"European Space Agency, ESA","The UNOOSA Space4Women project is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Permanent Mission of Israel, and Women in Aerospace Europe.

The strategy adopted for the definition of the action plan for gender equality in STEM careers by the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), initially due to the project and a view of its long-term sustainability, is based on co-creation. In particular, a co-creation approach has been applied to diagnose the situation with the same students and, on the other hand, to design more inclusive and collaborative workshops and bootcamps that allow students to know the STEM areas through collaboration, experimentation, and application to the resolution of real problems of their environment posed in the format of challenges.

Yet, there has not been great success in fixing the gender balance of IT professionals, especially in the technical fields. The ICT industry is suffering from expert shortage and there is need for a more diverse competence. This could be the moment for women to step out and enter to the industry. We cannot only wait for our education systems to deliver enough diversity for the labour market. In order to motivate more women to change their career to the ICT industry, we have to understand the professional motivation of women in the ICT industry. In this paper we use the stories of 23 women who are working in the ICT industry to learn more about the motivation, challenges and best practices for different career paths into the ICT industry. The results show that women in ICT value the creativity and diverse possibilities of the work in the industry and they see that industry could benefit from more diverse employees. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Expert shortage; Gender bias; Gender equality; Gender equity; Women in STEM","Employment; Motivation; Best practices; Driving forces; Education systems; ICT industries; IT professional; Labour market; Software industry; Technical fields; Software engineering",,,,,"Nokia Foundation","Acknowledgements.

Existing strategies aimed at increasing diversity in STEM, which are guided by the STEM “pipeline” metaphor and are deficit-oriented, have yielded lackluster results. Purpose/Objective/Research Questions/Focus of Study: This paper investigates how minoritized youth attempted to build connecting pathways between STEM-related worlds, how such attempts unfolded, and the resultant outcomes pertaining to their developing STEM expertise and subsequent STEM engagement. We introduce the idea of pathhacking, where youth had to create their own pathways into STEM, often with improvised tools and in treacherous territory, because there were no pre-laid paths. Research Design/Data Collection and Analysis: Data were drawn from longitudinal critical ethnography of 48 youths across STEM-engagement spaces, in both community and formal school spaces. Attention is paid to the particular resources, both relational and material, and the barriers that affect youths' efforts to hack pathways toward deeper and more connected engagement in STEM. Spaces included school classrooms, school settings, after-school STEM programs held in community clubs, other spaces in communities such as residential neighborhoods, and local universities. Findings/Results: Three broad claims are presented: (a) Pathhacking involves youth engaging in practices that challenge and expand ways of being in STEM-related spaces; (b) Pathhacking practices, when coordinated through social activity, reorganize social worlds for both individuals and collectives, expanding future pathhacking possibilities; (c) To aid in pathhacking, youth utilize tools including critical STEM-mobility artifacts and allies as brokers across scales of activity. Conclusions: The current U.S. education-policy climate focuses attention on student achievement in individual subject areas, highlighting the achievement gap. We illustrate the challenges minoritized youth face as they seek more consequential STEM engagement through hacking connecting pathways. Institutions, people, tools, and practices-all imbued with and embedded in histories-have structured these youths' opportunities to hack connecting pathways and have also provided points of access and resistance for the youth to resist marginalization during the process. © 2020 Teachers College, Columbia University.

Furthermore, the student body in STEM has narrowed since the number of female students in STEM fields decreases despite outreach activities. In order for the society to have enough appropriately educated work force, STEM attractiveness and increasing it is the focus of this concept paper. Although the lack of interest in STEM studies has been analyzed widely, we still have not been able to attract more (female) adolescents in STEM fields. Furthermore, previous research has shed light on the variety of STEM outreach activities, but the effects of these activities are not definitive. These concerns are common also in the Nordic countries, which has led to establishing an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnerships project 'Engineering Nordic Future' in 2018. One of the focus areas of the project pertains to the ways of attracting adolescents into STEM studies. As part of this project, the present literature review identifies the key features that contribute to the effectiveness of STEM outreach activities. The analysis focuses on K-12 activities targeted for (female)2 adolescents. The resulting model provides criteria for improving the effectiveness of current STEM outreach activities. The criteria may be applied to evaluate the impact of university-led STEM outreach activities and to guide related decision-making. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

Although there are some exceptions such as industrial engineering in which there is high participation of women, most of the engineering studies, and also other STEM careers, have low participation. In this sense, different factors influence the low participation of women in engineering studies. Among those factors, the support received from their context - family, friends, school, university, etc. - have a strong impact on the different stages of (future) engineers. A preliminary study conducted in Spain to analyse the support perception of engineering students during the different stages of their career.

Considering the high dropout rates and the continuing gender gap in computer science, the current study builds on the “leaky pipeline” phenomenon of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) by investigating belonging uncertainty in computer science as a predictor of students’ dropout intentions. In a study with first-semester computer science students (N = 217) at two time points, we tested the hypotheses that female students experience a greater belonging uncertainty than male students and that this belonging uncertainty is predictive of students’ dropout intentions. Furthermore, we explored whether belonging uncertainty is a more relevant predictor of female than male students’ intentions to drop out of computer science. In line with our predictions, our results show that female students experienced greater uncertainty about their belonging within the domain of computer science than male students and that belonging uncertainty significantly predicted students’ dropout intentions above and beyond the pertinent predictors academic self-efficacy, expectancy of success, perceived future utility value of the subject, and previous academic performance. Belonging uncertainty, however, was a relevant predictor of both female and male computer science students’ dropout intentions. © 2019, The Editors of the Journal.","Belonging uncertainty; Computer Science; Dropout; Gender; STEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrams, D., Thomas, J., Hogg, M.A., Numerical distinctiveness, social identity and gender salience (1990) British Journal of Social Psychology, 29, pp. 87-92; Bandura, A., (1997) Self-efficacy: the exercise of control, , W.

A wide selection of actions has been focused into getting more women for the STEM industries. However, the results have not been as efficient that would have hoped for. This study addresses the question how high-educated women perceive the attractiveness of software engineering studies. The data for the paper is collected with an open internet survey (n=134) from Finnish women who have already done or are planning to make a career change to the software industry. The attitudes towards new and old modes of learning and education are surveyed. This study shows that women perceive industry as attractive and value university education, yet there are overabundance of offering in entry-level training courses and lack of advanced studies. The university education is perceived to be rigid and old-fashioned. © 2019 IEEE.","Education; Re-education; Skills; Women in STEM","Education; Software engineering; Surveys; Finland; Internet survey; Skilled talents; Skills; Software industry; Training course; University education; Wide selection; Professional aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,"Schwab, K., The fourth industrial revolution (2018) Foreign Affairs, , https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-12-12/fourth-industrial-revolution, accessed January 23, 2018.

Previous studies showed how the gender gap presents some peculiarities: women result to publish less than men across all disciplines, and this is the reason why this publication gap is often referred to as 'productivity puzzle'. Strongly believing that gender should not influence the choice of the career to pursue, recent literature in organization has paid greater attention to gender related issues, analyzing the role played by team heterogeneity on performance. Such studies often obtained controversial outcomes, suggesting that the relationship between group heterogeneity and performance is a complex phenomenon. The dynamics taking place within working groups have been vastly studied in organizational psychology, showing that factors shaping group members' behavior are various. In this context, the working environment results to be a crucial factor. For these reasons, in this study we investigated the impact of heterogeneity on academic teams performance, taking into account gender representation in the overall working environment. More specifically, we evaluated the impact of diversity on the research conducted at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Biotecnologia of Politecnico di Milano, the first awarded technical university in Italy and at NECST Laboratory, a laboratory inside the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Biotecnologia. Data are available for scientific paper published between 1965 and 2018. In this paper we studied the transformations occurred inside Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Biotecnologia in terms of gender representation between 1965 and 2018, taking into account teams characteristics, research outcomes and productivity puzzle. The results obtained showed how in both cases the impact of heterogeneity varied according to perceived value of diversity. Heterogeneity per se does not account for a boost in performance. Gender heterogeneity leads to an increase in performance only when also inclusion is achieved. © 2019 IEEE.","Diversity; Gender gap; Performance; Productivity puzzle","Engineering education; Diversity; Gender gap; Organizational psychology; Performance; Research outcome; Scientific papers; Technical universities; Working environment; Productivity",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/ICTspecialistsinemployment, Eurostat-ICT specialists in employment, Accessed: 2018-10-30; Eurostat-Girls and Women Under-represented in ICT, , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/EDN-20170426-1, Accessed: 2018-10-30; OECD Countries List, , http://www.oecd.org/about/membersandpartners/list-oecd-member-countries.htm, Accessed: 2018-10-30; (2017) High-tech Leadership Skills for Europe-towards An Agenda for 2020 and beyond, , E.

Studies suggest that women have higher enrollment rates and achievements in Higher Education. Women also dedicate more time studying and are more committed attaining their degree than men. Although the percentage of female students' application in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses increased in the last years, there is still a greater proportion of women choosing higher education in social sciences and humanities areas. A sample of 723 1st year engineering students (66.8% male) was analyzed according to their academic background, their social origin and their habits of study. The results do not differentiate the Engineering Students according to their gender in socio-cultural variables of origin, however they significantly differentiate the two groups of students in their habits of study. Female students show greater organization of their time and activities of study, being also more thoughtful and self-regulated learners. At the same time, at the end of the first semester, they present a higher rate of successful curricular units and higher average grades. Some implications are highlighted for the teaching-learning process in engineering courses. © 2018 IEEE.","Academic expectations; Academic success; Engineering students; Gender; Higher Education; Learning outcomes","Engineering education; Engineering research; Professional aspects; Social sciences computing; Technical presentations; Academic expectations; Academic success; Gender; Higher education; Learning outcome; Students",,,,,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT: FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022674, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007136; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER","This work is financed by FEDER funds through the Competitivity Factors Operational Programme - COMPETE and by national funds through FCT - Foundation for Science and Technology within the scope of the project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007136 and FCOMP- 01-0124-FEDER-022674","This work is financed by FEDER funds through the Competitivity Factors Operational Programme - COMPETE and by national funds through FCT – Foundation for Science and Technology within the scope of the project POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007136 and FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-022674",,,,,"Dias, D., The democratisation of access and success in higher education: The case of Portugal and Brazil (2011) Higher Education Management and Policy, 23 (1), pp. 23-42. , Marinho-Araújo, C., Almeida, L., & Amaral, A; Casanova, J.R., Almeida, L.S., Diversidade de públicos no ensino superior: Antecipando riscos na qualidade da adaptação e do sucesso académico em estudantes do 1° ano Psicologia, Educação e Cultura, 20 (1), pp. 27-45; Almeida, Ls, Guisande, Ma, Soares, Ap, Saavedra, L., Access and success in higher education in Portugal: Gender issues, socio-cultural background and students' academic trajectory (2006) Psychology: Reflection; Benson, J.E., Make new friends but keep the old: Peers and the transition to college (2007) Interpersonal Relations Across the Life Course Advances in Life Course Research, 12, pp. 309-334; Credé, M., Niehorster, S., Adjustment to college as measured by the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire: A quantitative review of its structure and relationships with correlates and consequences (2012) Educational Psychology Review, 24, pp. 133-165; Bariani, I.C.D., Pavani, R., Sala de aula na universidade: espaço de relações interpessoais e participação acadêmica (2008) Estudos de Psicologia, 25 (1), pp. 67-75; Hagenauer, G., Volet, S.E., Teacher-student relationship at university: An important yet under-researched field (2014) Oxford Review of Education, 40 (3), pp. 370-388; Dennis, J.M., Phinney, J.S., Chuateco, L.I., The role of motivation, parental support, and peer support in the academic success of ethnic minority first-generation college students (2005) Journal of College Student Development, 46, pp. 223-236; Robbins, S.B., Allen, J., Casillas, A., Peterson, C.H., Le, H., Unraveling the differential effects of motivational and skills, social, and self-management measures from traditional predictors of college outcomes (2006) Journal of Educational Psychology, 98, pp. 598-616; Grebennikov, L., Skaine, I., Gender and higher education experience: A case study (2009) Higher Education Research & Development, 28 (1), pp. 71-84; Zimmerman, B.J., Theories of self-regulated learning and academic achievement: An overview and analysis (2001) Self-regulated Learning and Academic Achievement: Theoretical Perspectives, pp. 1-37. , B.

The first results suggest the high interest shown by the group in the talks of the mentors; a greater attention and predisposition of the male students are observed in the questions and interventions. The sensitization of the female group on STEM issues is surprising, although there is a low participation and interest shown by the topics discussed. All these aspects must be taken into account in the planning of future interventions. © 2018 IEEE.","Diversity; Female; Gender; STEM","Students; Diversity; Engineering degrees; Female; Gender; High school students; Innovative practices; Teaching centers; University students; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,,,,,,"Schreiner, C., Sjøberg, S., The ROSE project An overview and key findings (2010) Oslo Univ.

The second half of the paper reports the results of research conducted through narrative interviews of a sample of female university students who made the unconventional decision to enroll in degree programs in which they are a minority (engineering, computer science, etc.). Analyzing the ways in which these “divergent” choices develop and uncovering ideas about science that young women internalize can be useful tools for opening avenues that combat gender stereotypes in schools and universities. © 2019, University of Bologna.

Butterflies are an excellent example of a theme that readily bridges the sciences with the arts.
